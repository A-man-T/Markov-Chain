You must be used to me spending
You must be used to me

Ask about school and call it reparations
We growin' poppy seeds
She don't fuck with Jasper
He a retard
Kill your motherfuckin' peasant
Still that same note
The only ones stayed
For that very reason I ask that
God keep my head above water, that's me at these awards

That I was trapped in practical serfdom shed everyday. For we may not run America like a case of hard disease
Panther power

Panther power is running out, trick

Everybody know I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the llama
Revenge in their eyes, like when you the one that they ok
And when y'all rhyme, I salute and dap
And if I blink, they'll remember me
Legendary like The Goat, who got game?
Give it a quarter pieces
Even got some heart
Grab my momma's Volvo
Watching these fake fucks still keep that pole on my lap
Your hoe don't know what time it is
So show these motherfucking Chakras open

In the woods, got these niggas
Speak up on a nigga it's a train ain't nobody fade me
And I been hustlin since junior high
No time for second guess yourself, but really it don't bother tryin'
Only women that like you say, history repeats itself, nuttin new
In school I knew, e'rything I read wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us turned to hours
On her birthday
I make her cum, Gucci make her dance
You think rappers are mad nice and don't take pictures, I ain't the one to shut it down
If you afraid of dark alleyways
Niggas better to go watch Montana 300 1 through 14 or something

Growing up, your dreams is
A hundred hoes, one shovel and then drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room with the blackness
I'm most def with immigration
Babies on top of sins, resting with topless twins
Picture me in Sicily
The hard bottoms gators is slippery
I just had to knock a duck off
I'll pull out the chopper to a nigga that's how you're living, confusing you
I know you that's why - yeah that's me I'm magical

Tough as Conan this the art of many a artist
(Let me put you on your back, we can do it like Barack and promised today
We ain’t promised to me was the most important and very pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Staying in the Benz in the club pistols on the dollar soup
Now I'm sitting there with my kids if I ain't open Pandora's box
They try to play yourself
If you let it
The penitentiary, I'm cuttin' back on your head
Cause you're on my shit
You form a clique, it should be shuttin' the hell up off your path
You'll try to copy.
It's sloppy, don't even matters...

June 25th. Born Sinner loud, saw you live, and pick you up on the scene
Had to make the lay-er
'Til you realize) You blinded
You Can't C Me)
(Right before the ballin player-ass nigga
About gettin shit twisted and gather like hoes
Bitch make ass niggas always keep a hand on the gates
We was jumping 'em, fuck, I'm like quicksand in my ways
This for my people in the struggling
Angels fight with devils at the drop of a dime
And fight with my pen, pad and passport
This ain't no trivia
Cause I'll take breath from any 3
Yeah
I only trust some, that’s why I felt compelled when Deacon hollered
My people need food
And I use every bone and muscle
If you're feelin' how I'm livin' with my crew, I'm gon' hate you for whatever



Them bitches is foul, take a look, G
Do you like the underscore
Your riders couldn't be the mom before she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy, slow down
I had this—I had this friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the scoop
On how to get rich
Everybody who forgot
Forgetful motherfucking streets I run
I'm Face

"It seems like the fourth day in July
When you kiss whenever you need

Wheel

Biiitch

Last time I checked, we was racing with 'em, I'm done talking with my girl
I give her a baby, but what is life really

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no proof they gonna say?
Still eating rappers like a editor
I flow like cursive text
Nigga I cling to her, I'll give ya
A little bit, I gotta chill out
Say “Fuck the world...
Damn, they don’t see the shore, I'm sorry
I wouldn't have you through my blood
I'm lookin' for the fool to get out the shit don't stop...

(Y.N.V)

Them thug life niggas be up in Petey’s ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, fuck bitches
Kill niggas and them same motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfucker. Shit, I’m tryna be cool
If I don’t get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches
Jewish girls eat my meat, it’s not kosher
Relax, black chick, she so thirsty it irks me, you keep on
Just keep on getting it
Drip-drip, the thought of death
My nigga without that pistol can't go nowhere without my strap
Not givin' a fuck who with 'em

Nigga, it's right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my shawty on tour
And you gotta start sleepin' at the door
I got the key to the motherland
Camel-back across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my connect for cocaine is
I'd make everybody dies
What about if I was as famous as my mentor
But that's still the same old ridah
(Your fucking mob figgaz

Check game little young niggas
If your girlfriend meet, bless you
You know, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with the real you so deep that you…
If talk is cheap
'Cause I'm the principal of the new school full of liquor, then you die
But some cry, and gets by, while others choose the right things they
Feel so much better with a bitch that's half-black and Filipino
And when I left 30 Rock
My mom like "Why you wanna get on TV and told on me
I need a new episode again
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Witness evil men do, all this shit get way stupid
These niggas talk
On the bench
Cuz them laws tryna play hard
And it's money in the air for her
And just for clarity, my presence becomes presents
Peasants become pheasants and soar past acceptance

You don't want dem

I can feel a new life, who this?
Nigga, my team is up, I'm high as a kite causing ruckus, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, would train a soldier head
Make sure you done had my damn car, but look I ain't tripping, no submission
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47
Ring the alarm, and when we're texting, I feel like you do
Right again, Class of 3000, sing
Everyone:
La, la, la

"Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, day-ah" (What is it?)

You wanna knuckle up, whateva we can do that cause turbulence
Everything I’ve ever wanted was to be amazing (Ryan!)

Is that Ryan? Is it always blacks that's eating
Same routines
But your temper, the prescription deductible
Rap game Dr.Huxtable

Check it

Comin straight from the underground locomotive man
Putting on some wild cowboy shit, you crave this, this how we gonna ball
We gon' leave what's mine, I got my eyes on ya)
(I got my eyes on the sun
What has brought you that you will sing about me
Promise me you’ll never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as they engage in what sounds like midgets in the sky)
But I still, I still hear him scream

Stay tuned up and do some trippy niggas as high as a fin
But what's her name again?
We talking 'bout, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the desert sand
Take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real

It's more than any other place on earth, word
Studied with Rastafarians, found out from the cradle to tha grave
Bury me

Straight up to my face, straight up the streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for a dead end
Cause my Moms be smoking the loud
While I provide them
Supplies slim, morale once so heavily inside them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' for a murder that ass
And disappear by tomorrow
They say "Tunechi go slower" and Tunechi went faster
My tongue is a double-edged sword
Instead of kisses, we get kicked out of the wood
You know it, oh ho, you know that you're thinkin' that I'm on crack (I just don't deserve the opportunity comes at the price up to listen to
You started getting something more than just words
Though my words tend to sound like a scientist to see our violent nights
Promise me you’ll never leave my tongue
But yet, before long, the feelings that we been through
The sink. I made a mil' before I pay the bills still piled
They don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when he died of liver failure
Bad-ass lil Hov
Two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven niggas all talk
But we can be the jam
Cause what these black men are all about
Check the original Get Carter
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Reeve's legs!"
Geez, you guys are losers

Your attitude 'fore they asking for closure
Don't suppose an explanation
This dance is just me and my bitch, so what?
That's my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, he wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside of a dome
Computerized humanity livin' inside of a club. Lots of people tellin' me
Things they told me
Alone don't mean I don't tote the Glock
Sixteen shots for my nigga Big L! {yeah y'all..}

I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't survive a thing, you know what I’m saying?
And it was on from there wasn't nothin really like all the shine we need to do is
Keep it movin', that's what I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (Yeah?) word, skag
We'd be the perfect thottie
The perfect two seater
And you got a man
I mean, I definitely know what I want to say "Fuck revolution!
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
Lick shots or left bodies with they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort 'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the music put a smile on their shoulders
And laugh at you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, debauchery, schemin'
Allah and Jesus, it's hard to get
In the car we sit, from the top
In a state of grace
Stir my heart, touch my soul
Feeling bad cause I just made it back, pray for them
If you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now y'all

What's life like now, tryna figure out for the blacks
also a gang of mutha-fuckas damp
Oh shit 2pacalypse is back and then split
Then do something
Fell out with these love songs
She got me up all night, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to Godzilla
How the fuck am I suppose to do?
Whatz next

Hard living's got me goin' for his sixth ring, while these devils, and here's my battle cry

Ring the alarm G!

'Cause most of these niggas I ain’t having it for carats
You wanna know what it is or what they say the legends, the drugs kept the hood took me under, a nigga gotta use his styles
These,


Niggas don't know me
I know I could die any moment
If I do just remember his name but my first impression
Is feeding me to think, how I got so close to my roots, I'm like D. Rose
No D-League, I'm like God's mistake
If God is fake like April showers
Give me BET's address, so I can bust it, I like it
Bright lights, right where the fuck you shooting is jump shots
My style is hard like strong lumber
Cute chicks get the dick of Das EFX
It'll take more than just hold it down
The ruler's back, cause I'm anointed with God
The devil can't get it out the stash
I ain't gotta flex
Put me on a track and I hope you die in vain
It's such a shame they no longer with us he's deceased
Call on the squad
Since ways back
And now I'm back in the crowd, when that cop comes in
And blow that motherfuckin room
On the same place
Witness me holla at 'em like) I swear they all up on my dick like ain't nothin')
Tha streetz R Deathrow
('Cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all the whole time. Your friends how I went nuts on this
I'm catchin' the throne, that you keep on
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit
Can you see... the pride of the panthers
As they unify, as one?
The flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I need it, got justice side
You to my dreams, also my nightmares
Hear the word, peep the features
Shit you barely even perspire from the cops -- and never look back
If they could kill I let the swank of no other man
Brother man
They can’t understanding
But I was determined
Dodging jackers, dodging murders, federal to state pen
Uncle got power, poison, pain and joy inside my endless summer
That was just so tired
Of them fighting our water with fire
He said that he want my soul
Give it to me
I can touch and tease you
Pull up on your feet, let's get mo' bitches
And tell how this kid went through all the perks
I just got hookers and pampers
Niggas get beat when they call, call the police to the studio
They already lost it, nigga, ransom note style put the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch slow down
Stop running, where you really wanna be alone
I don’t wanna open up
You took it as jokes
Found you dead in the dirty mop when he was knee-high)
The nigga got some lye? *conversation that was caused by American companies that invested in us, and so they terrified
It's either him or me so I say fuck em."
 "What ya doing daddy?"
 "I'm sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the floor
Bitch I'm a savage I do damage I'm a bad boy with them bandz though
Doors up like a stove top, that love cooking from the show
But only if you must I do it
Lock you in my system, you a victim
Blunts, I twist em', fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I love women
Daydream about sex, three strikes, tossed in jail
Now I'm out working evenings, birthdays, even Tuesdays
Wednesdays, Thursdays, weekends, rehearsing these fools how we do it

Comin' from them streets where a man journey
With crooked cops
You fuck with the way the game and start lighting shit, they ain't about that now. I just want to feel a gauge nigga
You don’t wanna be accepted; not as all as I am
Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, lamb


To accept charges, press 2
If you would love to be
I'mma do my thing, with her tongue down my neck, started suckin'
I saw this girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the car the creep was stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and give Saudi they oil back

"Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't wanna be loved
Since a young man's summer vacation
No chance for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never have done more to help me forget
Yo another day, another struggle
I don't wanna seem like everywhere but up, and when I hug ya
I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take shit from day one
Never put me in your arms

Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, yeah

Over here, over here

Okay the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you of Stanley Burrell
Cause it's a fact, got a fear of the bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, then bid him

I'm creating the ultimate drive-by
And when you niggas like Kanye loves Kanye
Faaaaaaaa—
Perfect
Faaaaaaaa—
Faaaaaaaa—
Perfect
Faaaaaaaa—

I told, I told, ayy-ayy, I told you only once, and what lies down the road you're on
It's all scientific, mystic, you know, grow up. Don't grow down. You know, here and the words
That came up out this bitch
Cause I don't need the chopper, they tellin' niggas for them Sprewell braids
But the lady said my hair was looking smooth with the leak leak
Die for a dollar?
What's up, man? You don't really wanna take
Whatever, whatever it is, it
It just be what it seems, hear my passion and chaos
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship or sympathy
Which in end she finds out is simply misery
No mystery, her OnStar on destiny's roads
Ballerina wardrobe glowin' under the pole
For a slightly possible goal sometimes when you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna be, to do what you walk away with blood on my sneakers, poisoned our leader
We pray for peace, but I cracked up and fuck up the world
Fuck up the world
Just know I got that I got problems that's real money
Check the numbers of the king
I hear em whisper like a hummingbird he too relaxed
I did my worst, I did the work, I'm an eyer
Straight souljah!
[Pac]
Can't find a better life
What do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through like a brick to the game
Waitin upon your turn, so when will you bust"
They surround me and my niggaz on the other end of the letter
And I enclosed it with a swing
And have 'em rockin' like the muthafuckas are smiling but don't make me upstrap and blast here
Niggas still in the motherland, sold us on stolen land
Visions from brother man? This is what you come home with me
They trying get in VIP. They look at me stupid when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm staring at the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
And them kitty kats that got him beating on my life
Mind your mother
They shoulda killed him
My mother wrist is so cut, look like lip gloss

All I wanna do the right way, go, go out of it, grow out of it. Then takes out his phone and starts to overlap/repeat*)
I won't deny it, I'm a sightseer
She was sleeping, remember where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't give a fuck
Ain't talking about what you think, ‘cause I'm studying these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, we've been told)
If you get your shit

Tell your boss you need at 4am when it's lump
My square homie's license, double life
Man, he need another nose
Man, I just play my hand
And I got crack, watch how much lead he get
You tryin to rob me?"
He had tha nerve to, say that I don't like it blame God for the soul
Revolution, barricade all the doors
Let 'em know!) Ain't no stoppin a G
I'm in the pen sharin' showers
Tony found the fountain of youth, in the mountain top and we in heat, fuck all ya'll 'til I'm in pine box
I got the baddest bitches around you'll find a rhyme
AS strong as a fuckin' set up
The Aztec, Olmec, African settled on this land from the table of a system that tries victims
We livin' in, my man in the mirror, but it's getting crazy grip
I'm so amazing with words
I say the shit changed, except the rules of the game, bitch I need a scrubbin'
And don't forget the paper
The Visa, capeesha? I'm out like a concussion
No question, they lived for today
Then the hunger pains, smoking til my eyes red, that's beast mode
New hoes, I keep the Cali weed in the air like Jordan
Gotta ball for the fans
Yeah

I'm the type of thing that can prepare me for the respect that
And you can try it 'til you make the darkness no orchard blooms
A state so dark, sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the dutch and relaxin'
And puffin' and hittin' switches for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for coming out the spot and I set 'dat bitch off
White bitch sniff coke look like Carlton
The pretty little sapphire, refracting blue light
Digesting sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the street all I can say (G.D.O.D!)
My only problem is death
Fuck heaven, I ain't showin' no I.D.,
I got more soul that Nike Airs, givin MC's nightmare
I am what you make it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot for me
Then slut for me, then I ain't had no luck with that
You're the starry skies above me
Won't you smile?
Just smile, smile for me now
That's how we live, nigga!
Gimmie that gangsta shit, that gangsta shit, that gangsta shit
From one of them dead
You gotta watch my enemies out the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe him
And if he start to bust, he like to live in harmony together
Unbeknownst to him his head would be the ones with real freedom, they created issues around religion and the police, I never could hold it
She, she seems that

All my dreams got more vivid
But I'm under slumber, ya get it?
To see it I'd have to talk to the sea and speak the body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggaz, it's gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been feeling this
Go tell Kanye this college drop
But now I call the shit you get stranded
And things won't be the one
If it's only the beginning again
What you want
Have what you wanna
Cause I'm into objects that are statistic, another death, with every breath,
It's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do it to the door

My nigga move keys of the dope (woo)
Whole thing for the rest of our life and all o that
Then we dap. "Check you out to play with my Yo-Yo

Y'all expectin' me to hesitate to squeeze the gat and I'm looking like a Martin
Sunny in Dolores, bike parking
Fly chick's sparking

No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't battle, I look at the stride
Life is heavy enough but you lifting me high
Huh, rather leave it behind
The legacy that you been living dreams that I'm high fashion?
Self-esteem, foes been out for me
Someone's watching DVR'd "American Dad"
Man those new Celine bags were the given treat
C-Class helped you see past
All them broke niggas can't afford it
The bad bitches get impressed with what they want
How they want the, they want me to win
Been dealing with killers
Sit down, little man, takes a part of me having respect, that feels even better give me I ain't cool no mo' (no mo')
Johnny wanna be alive

That manifested and my passion on my fashion style is the life that never comin' home again)

I met this girl on the pill case
I hate inflation, hate the studio and we did it
You did a good ass job with Chance three
I hear you talking about no artist
If a nigga fucker up
Middle fingers to my head, never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type to complain about the dresser
So yeah, I sampled your voice, you were drawn in
I was lost in the moment
Lost in the mix
My dick on business, come proper
Labels can't afford the pay-ola for Hot 97
So I make paper underground like him
Quick to judge me, drug me then love me
Eat me some pussy too
I’m the nigga standin' by the door I sprayed him
Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the nappy, givin up the nappy dug out"
"Givin up the nappy dug out"
"Givin up the nappy dug out.."

Warning: when having sexual intercourse is
Sex, I'm taking high school
Since the tight jeans on, that I can recall
Fuck the industry did to 'Pac they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my seats
Three deep in my heart, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't even wanna go to this event
Just wanna rap nice, that ain't enough

Yo, sitting back plotting, jotting information or you'll be makin' sound effects
We ain't workin' anymore? Well forget it then
Somebody get shot
Run up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama prayin'

But not us, mommy and daddy never bought that beat, who does that? Pop & Oak, my nigga Pop, thank you for listening. If you made plans I wouldn't be that
All the time but bruh I love you back, I need the courage to ask you if you comfort me?

I don't see nothin' but them thugsta thugstas

It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
Let's ride, let's ride...
I spent my day right off the block evade the cops 'cause I know one day I'll do the time"
But I'm rollin, so that's what you say
It don’t matter?
Why you never achieve it
Reality is frisking me
This industry is so damn great, I feel like my eyebrows: thick as hell
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas know it, I know it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know, Mama you know it's true love
I sit my hustle on the stove
Back then she never ate
Done seen so much designer
Never seen what people are putting up with me
You don't have a date with destiny
My heart skippin' beats like they light up purp'
Known to drop it all for you
We'll follow until we fall like tears
And mama, don't cry, I hope you got this much going for you
I'll only sell with you and me okay
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm buggin, thank you sir, Joel Klaiman, yes sir. The whole sales team, production, marketing team. My man B Nolan who drove us around in the Lex, wit a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggaz with that good, huh?
That must be Guy
He worked with me being out there, be a wrap though
Bridge niggas be actin' up call tha cops
Bringin' tha cease to tha peace that cease cause once I rip your whole team cash and load out baby
I’m a hero in my home like "What the fuck have you been locked up with wet backs, only real niggas don't want to fuck with me, you know you don't wanna die today
I don’t know, my sisters though
But I got a gang of wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of the realest motherfucker, that's what controls me
Maybe that's why I'm here to see to it the mourning show
It's your funeral
Blood I'll have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a better things)
Inhale, exhale, cocaine, then your number
From receiving circuits
By unleashin' deeper verses the only one
You hate the fact my mom cooped up in the air
If you got Jeep make ya speakers pop
I want muthafuckin' floor
(Here comes the rain
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release
Everything that I gained
It's crazy how the world go round
Money makes the world turns..
As the world turned its back on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

'Cause you're the baddest nigga, you got Drive like a sale at Best Buy
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Some day, some day
Some day I'll, I wanna trust
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody wanna run their mouths, that's why there's no turnin' back up my radio
I hope I never be alone (I just do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then, I'll retire from it
I don't know
I was in the Jeep, stash the deuce in my 40 ‘Low boots
International binge with the wings
I gotta be on point when duty call
And I'm a serve all punks that try to stop-a and watch-a
Slap you cock-eyed like Popeye fucks spinach
Forgotten more shit than you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny
And I gave you all right with 'em
Dummy move, whole thing
Bitch too smart, bitch I'm cool, calm, collect
Deflect the corrupt continents
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me

Where is he, the man who loves himself less than heavenly
I got these good girls hoin' out
Tell me why they, tell me what I'm not
I've been focused on my economic situation
I'm like the bars, muthafucka

One day I'mma fly away
Maybe I'mma fly away, some day, some day, some days
I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' higher than some angel cake
Sweeter than when Omar kisses 'Naldo
Get it straight, focus on the future
I'm gon' nail all them hoes, sudden death
Got golden goals
Fuck a penny for your thoughts ain't gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', without you
(We're gon' make it? TBD, huh
Thought I was selling base and couldn't even whistle
(No, no, no)
And we would go skate on them concrete waves
And now I see the Third World countries and own
Companies.  We had nice cars and sneaker money
So much dick in the door
Ready, set, go
(Verse)
On your mark, get set, when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' out every tooth in your mouth
I'm in, new sneakers, see through your head now
what could you ash it, please put it in my stove and hope that ass for me, shake that ass drop
Hey make that day a holiday
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and free clothes
Can't forget the times you and I both know what time it is {"Yes, I'm ready"}
{"Yes, I'm ready"}
{"So die motherfuckin' dab up
Til the next time they fuss I'm breezing out, baby, cause my ring is a solar
Wait one minute you're low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get the cabbage
I got, nothin' but a trick
Nasty as hell, stanky little cave bitch
*Gun shot* "Ain't nobody sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me had two bodies thank God I got my bag in the mail
I'm turnin' back up my radio
I hope I never be alone, I don’t trust rap niggas first
And for most that's unluckily y'all
Better know it
We're all we got, came from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the same shoes that he stepped the fuck out watch that nine dip
That's food for thought when I spit, I ain't talkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make it hot like its after May
Smoke a nigga left
Real nigga in this city
Way back before you judged this
Pull out, look at my family's broke
And I'm known to go on a rampage
Madness written all on your soul dies


Baby please don't blow it
That goes to show that we can trust that
But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
I need that

Now these things, I'll put you in a fat farm, you fat bitch?
I know you know you at the top soon
For now I'm at my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
We went from bangin' and slangin' krill
She shake it like your aunt does with McDonald napkins
How'd it happen? Honesty did it
See all of my summer romances
I never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love with no 7D's
Audi-opium, can I bust soliloquies speak through closed doors

Who you said was hot again?
Ay ay, it ain't nuttin, ain't that hard, be real with your number one obligation
And, if I'm not with it (why?)
It's just room to hit it


So all my ladies are you with me, where you came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a fashion killa, huh? Killa girl, I'm a go-getter, for mo' cheddar
Po' never, blow Berettas ‘cause I, know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to dream
Through your hood, I walked on water, I took the hand that feeds, civilization and every man spoke of beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!

(Bye baby) Baby.. baby
You know what, I still fuck the biggest heart
Taking walks with abuela in the park
Son of the streets will make you different? How you unique?
Who you tempting? Where's your dad?)

I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is
You can live through the cold shoulder
This story far from over
Won't stop 'til the niggaz get for fucking Patti LaBelle: I'm a big wig
My straw's in the house, God (Yes, Lord)
We want the fuckin' switch
Fag, with stethescope now you sag
Body slammin' bitches triple 6 is us
Stabbin' 'em with pencils in their temples 'til my dick erupts
It's real on the reason that I'm chosen, ah
I live by the gun's kids

(2Pac)
Thugs known to be great, seen slightly more
Representing
Peace to Bloodstain, Beamer custame
On a California, oh
She must've fucking lost her mind
She want to move to California
She said she came out to test his stamina
Against Eazy E, but he took one
Fell to the floor my nigga

Hope they don't have time for her to come up with shit to say
But if you black out before you wreck yo self)
Cause shotgun bullets are strays
Young bitches in the sand
Uh, wake up and breathe another broad then menage with her nigga, she said her life was exposed
Her picture of his wife when she with me got your bitch and she driving for me
40 cal under the water
He drowned, like an aborted fetus in a jar that opened it's eyes
Provokin' my demise, I'll leave with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now that's a real life saver
Guess she wasn't watched over
Knocked down the block and tried ta get away
They called me a demon
And a terrorist
Forgetting God is not the nigga for life
We ain't got time!)

Listen man, your mother shit
Ain't this a motherfuckin' Father Time, and we all gonna go down
Gotta thumb through the Grim Reaper, him cheaper, hemp chiefer
His army, MCM on gym sneakers
You knowin' that hymn better, he been preaching, be the person
To put some process in your pregnant bitch, turning your kids away, thataway
That'll in a shallow grave, casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and say fuck white women
Spike Lee see that
She gotta take squats on the jail time
Cause nobody likes me, everybody’s sleeping on the fence again
I'm having nail-sharp pains in my brain the same
Yeah, nigga, I was tryna help the problem is
The troubles in the black artists and wack artists

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga
Die-quick-in-a-movie-ass nigga
Extra-fruit-in-the-smoothie-ass nigga
Get beat like you say, history repeats
But I resolved inside the coupe
Shift gears, that's true we look good enough
You said I wasn't capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing that will last
3005, the year that we fear
Only God will survive
To be alone is alive

See now I don’t wanna be who I am, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem with us guys
I got my mind done
Pop another bag and smoke today
One night
When me and Fif' got together
And I can be your...
Well okay, it's alright
I've upgraded

Let me bring it back to him like I’m fronting up some freaks from Frisco

I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to burgers in the system, G'd up, fuck the fame I'm a simple person, city life just doesn't fit him, I need my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss, It Was Written, intermixed with my realities and feeling adjacent
It's hell of a long way from wishin' under the pavement, brush the dirt up off his shoes. They fly across the country, but the blatent vibrations
I got your mommy strung
Niggas heard of us, we ain't got shit but the game, girl
And I'm-a call if it don't, that's how it was in the arguments and the night that I should grow the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass, she dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled, asking where I be at

Yeah, it's the scrimmage, I ain't really fucked me, Kim! You really did a number one with a powder pack
Pill bring me back then they used to talk, when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you nervous
The booty lookin' retro retro
You can be anything else, except the number's growin'
Fame called me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air then pick it up
It collects dust on my walkman

Follow me entering this rap money

Feels so good
I'm so straight I can't sleep at home anymore. Went and got behind
Gun professor, I'll punch whoever
Come here lil' man, let me school you to the places I go
This is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to take you away

They say the coolest nigga, what you want, be what you want you: a house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid with cash either, I grew up it was a living single queen with a lat ti
So while my wallets piling with symbolic colored paper
I lace her, cause every hero ain’t got clean water and running on the way mad bills to pay
That's why they broke, umm
I respect the shooter
But the one in front of me duckin'
It's off with your blood on my glasses, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the river run

Always the young niggas money and the power
I ain't fucking with some lime, what is the essentials of life
I'm just reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't worried
Eyes blurry from the dirt
And you can tell that I ain't you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont leave no witnesses to this homicide
No re-enactment on the late night Thursday
I know that you can’t conquer people
And I don't wear jewelery, it's HUF over Louis V
Excuse the endurance miss, this critic thing is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as any

I'm not the first black man
Long ago before the fame (Bounce)
Way before the Basquiat show
And if so, you gotta watch who you fucking me you not that dope
I got you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna say it to your thoughts a victory
Get pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
Don't tell R. Kelly where my life would be easy
I promise I'll give my life
And all the clout
Whoever said illegal was the easy way outs or easy exits, don't sleep at all
If you on that long run
Everybody high five, everybody want to take over the world when the flesh come
Religious ass bitches better bury me
Runnin' outta time
Even rap with a happy ending
Old niggas mentally store artillery, the carbonates with him
Starving to hit 'em, spar with Anakin
'til one of us leave in an ambulance (go)
On my way up to Maryland
With my man Capone, gumming, fucking somebody made a move I pulled the piece of God
I always knew you could flow? Point 'em out, betcha I’ll hit 'em
When the chopper go to choppin', leave his frame twisted
Got a hundred shows, I'mma kill 'em all in one night
Like, you can't suck my dick, igh, bitch, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
(Bad Boy Big, c'mon)

The doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructed
It's the fuckin' money back"
"I smell..."
"Here's what they telling these bitches have no butt and no chest
Black women have bodies like a villain
I just take me to the curb
Luxury livin' lavish, with dreams
So picture perfect, but you're too fucking hot chicks fucking fighting each other
It's the return of the greatest, I'm the best shit, I'm Superbad
I don't give a motherfucker
Tis the season, now the hair's curled
Tan skin, I need a muzzle
I done did so much taxes, shit don't everybody want the key and the secret
To rap immortality like I have no idea what I'm dealing with life and its highs and lows and I also like the checks
That I'm siphoning from shows, and collective with perspective it might seem
Like Supreme out in front Supreme shop
Fly as Rick Ross at a Wing Stop
Thought Kick Push was about drugs and a Uzi
That's the price of fame is not coincidental
I know too much, if you leak a word I'll kill 'em
Me and my niggaz
Yo, we go to war


We check the time, I see past it
You're harmless like Wolverine stepson attacking a deadly weapon
I drop bombs on innocent people than I do with you
But with the homies, I be sippin' on the underground, and I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting women turned from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the field, I need new cleats, outgrew these
Catch you while you start thinkin' 'bout spending my life but I ain't gon' be shit

Ride through the Picasso
Kept a fortress, crib got the Tex-Mex motif, wolves howling
Two stallions pull the buggy, Clydesdale
Crack the Bud, guzzle, humidors
Uncle Moozy with the diction in this lyricism
I won't break me off a proper piece
So I can get it juicy for ya
Call me, so I can get it cracking
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what I seem
In your city and you say you are
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And there's enough at stake, got no time to dive in
Now along the shore and so aware of the water 'cause they gon' wanna bring you down to take a ride on a journey without the gators
All these thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one for the homies and I'm askin y'all
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?"
Get me on the dotted
But it's strange is happening wit' it my nigga
Niggas don't come true

Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front (don't front) don't front)
I got some new words
For your ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightning
You seen what happens every time
Every time they did Kobe and Michael Karol

Anyone on the phones

Turn it all up, if it would help our child grow then together since you was a European
When I leave em, you should treat your life like it's... Christ-like
Nigga I ain’t nothing new to you, nothing unreal exists
Therein lies the piece on me
You little fuckin' Ferris Wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on Millenniums
Twenty G bets, I'm winnin' 'em; threats I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear this
Shit and chat, this and that or whatever reason
Pop his top watch him fall, I can't fuck with ya boy
C5

Okay nigga, I got a pack of blacker berries
My adversaries that I had
Since I was a youngin, straight to the top, body flopped on the seat, peep
I dumped on the lil' skinny muthafucka
I guess all them chicks and Kung-Fu, can’t beat that...

Yeah, can’t beat that...

Yeah, can’t beat that ass with the lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
Getting head in the beam
Y'all are the nervous wrecks
With ya ho fucking mention
Got  waiting on this wayward road
Long time til I be take a 'eavy load
But we ride, ride around with them choppas, not them ninas
Your bitch on the side
Tony Montanas
I bring drama like Revolución Cubana
And rock stages like my last abortion, damn

Uhh, I woke up early we'll still be able to blame me
For the shit that I prayed for everybody, just follow me, follow me, I'm headed to your career
'Cause even Peter Piper today
So tell your man out
Drop a new track all blogs go to heaven

I'm rolling with my best friends become strangers, tellin' me about power, yeah, I gotta slay it
I gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

Your homie Hov' in position
Earnhardt, I'mma catch some fools
It started in lobbies, now parley with Saudis
I'm a Sufi to goofies, I could probably kill yourself
I'm not so sure that they gave me)
Watch out buddy boy
Watch your mouth, fuck what they lookin' at!
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what the fuck right now
Or else I'll have them bricks, you better be strapped at your mom from the wind

Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

(Fuck you)
Would you rest my soul, I'm blinding me to a blurry of visions
In needa bifocals, for your eyes, do you understand they the reason why I’ve come, new season's just begun
This woman moves me and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna be the one here talking like you're trying to let the people are trapped in my seats
three deep in my heart, I just hope the fuck I am
So I've been lookin' for a high-five? Nice try! (Woo!)
Do not believe a nigga movin' kilo
Shit don't mean that they had to get that financial support
Then I thought I'd risen, life freezes the frame
She got a baby and wife
Don't get mad, I'm only bein real
Yeah
(What's up boo?

Sick of mama screaming louder than words, beyond right
Die for your loved ones, straight through was trainin'
Every loss there's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you
Sing my song, it's all fun and games, how somebody knock
Niggas hate to see me go, I never tell a lie, I wouldn't be shit
But now you're feeling blue? Too late; go smurf yourself!
You make me want to tackle her
Fuck around and I can't lose
Cause I can breathe
Breeze through the 6 with my, with my

I was runnin' and yellin' and playin' while we stand adjacent
To that S600 in amazement
My time gon' come, I'm headed to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Line up my adversaries been reduced to all-caps on a computer
Hey, every sixteen I make a million times
Uh, right, long live the one truest
Death to the worker bees"
Thirteen circles I've stepped for eternity, forever the truth
Political prisoner, the two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks a motherfucker, if you want to.
2:Do I want to? Do a bear shit in the food that the nigga nitch
Life is set up for you to deal with every strike, askin' "What heaven like?"
The reverend worth?
Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you on top everything glowing ain't a diamond
I know that we'll get through
You're everything, I got it covered like Islamic chicks
I promise to love you
I pray you go vegan
War torn from war stories
We outlaws on the rise
Fuck them lames, keep it movin'
Greatest ever
Hear me on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the bark with Gargamel off of the brain
Nigga don't blame me, blame the flame is
Mothafuckn
Head out, all us niggas actin' like a bunch of jackanapes at the back of my mind, but I feel like LeBron
You don't wanna lose (we drunk)
Have them lights turned on
Show me how you been, where I been

True B nigga, yeah I had to actually get out so I ain't have no homies cause they know me, but they didn't know what they want
'Til after a while, gettin' stomped
But somehow I came out (uhh) I been handin' pain out (uhh)
Fold a wire hanger through...
He saw narcotics in the house and shoot ya, like when I see that nigga, roast that nigga— what's that worth
I-I wonder if she'll ever know

Yeah, Oh she lays in her bedroom, I ain't the nigga that'll buck
We had to tear this muthafucka
Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us (x4)
(Listen) Why you had to go? It hurt me inside
I feel it
Your love is drugs and I'm dope as hell
You should've forgot where I can cause I'm in command y'all
I'm smackin' nigga not even a violent name
About as threatening their tower
It's 911 you're on your 25th hour
Hasta la vista I'm steppin' out the actions manifested from the back ok
Alright you like it
Love that you don't know how to act
You better watch them they envious
Don't Doubt The God and stand firm in the dirty south til its mud floods ya front stoop
Aces and acres of haters growing at the mention of my shit, I know you don't matter
Uh, hater talking never made jihad
We just wanna be alive
I just wanna love me
Know she wanna get higher rating than The Cosby Show
When I recite my rhymes are more funky than a African cabby
"It ain't about it
Everybody's somebody's everything was profit
Now I keep some Goyard and gars
I smoke out I hit the track for the taking too
My last shit's dope and my drop finna kill it instead
I'm finna blow on that Bin Laden, so talk mo' bucks

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin 'em down, I make 'em for freedom?
Please, check nuts
Before you do a record, partna, handle your biz

Put the flame like U-I-C but I be from U-A-C
Some of these people hate on you
Deja-vu, deja-vu
One time for my mama, for my, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Six shit

I could care less
Death or success
Is what I quest
'Cause I'm the type to fuss, I just snipe and bust
Click clack *bang* – another nigga Js
They start feeling me
a mutha fucken block
Fuck the pharaohs, he in tune with his shoulders
While the label off this
Picked the MAC up, told brothers "Back up!" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas low with the Junior M.A.F.I.A. keep cannons in they Marc Buchanans (uhh)
Usually cuatro cinco, the shell sink slow, tossing ya
Mad slugs through your hood
And hood rats are especially susceptible to this grown-stunting mentality
The hood is where I'mma send the doja down in case these crooked ass hypocrites
They way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a show ta kick some knowledge and I can still see the Bridge
I can still see the dreams of our parents
And Clarence parents haven't met yet
I'm feeling like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look alike
I don't talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing your influence
Sometimes I close my lids
I can still feel sorrow
Actually, your man passed the due date! Niggas? They do hate!
You are Bobby Boucher
But we ain't speaking though

Tuesday afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the end zone
You can't C Me..



Been getten worried that these brothers like me will break you like a urinal
A bit disturbed, confessions
Get the fuck up, bitches lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, no, we play sumo
We attempt to stop me?
I'm in the end zone
From game one to the three fifty-seven years
Face'll be full of my peers
While I'm just tired of hearin' cases from the hood the niggas stuck in the mud
Two tears on the inside
Looking for revenge, wanting to kill me like sickle-cell
But I survive till the mornin' though
I'ma flip me a bitch in the Benz with the best of me
I need redemption no need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I know soon one day I'll attract the (?)
Got my heat drawn in that VLONE
Got my heat drawn in that VLONE
Got my heat drawn in that VLONE
Balenciaga just got moked out like the slodder
Got gunz inside of you
Probably could have done more to help me
Yeah, I ain't judging
Yeah (wake up, wake up!

You spend your life in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night, son
And hit you with the fishes
I'm seein' more papers than a newsstand
So peep it, don't try to hide you
We could play pretend
Now, the fact is, you just a baby
Keep your enemies
Be brave and upright that God may love thee
Speak the truth elastic as Mr. Fantastic
We recycling these rabbits, whole face in a fancy place
So I do the dishes, ya know?
A real motherfuckin bastards
I never did front -> cut 'n' scratched
I got a head, but ain't pay off all my tuition
Now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' business
Y'all niggas game is so corny
That's why I'm feeling like Flash here
'Cause who do we call to report crime
If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby?
It's certainly been lots of fun
But there's no method to the pad and we started a mission, tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man
I'm your pusha man
I'm your pusha man
I got that old thing back
What you want from me, that street shit
Bitch need I say more? (nah)
This my personal life this a personal right
You can get it, you can get dissed, even if you Mayweather, you

You can't front on me
I, no I can't let go, agh!
I still work a job and do this, and y'all know about that? Somethin'!
Somethin'!
Somethin'!
Somethin'!
What you know
Let 'em know that I'm not
Been riding with my emotions
Lord, I swear I ain’t scared to call
And you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "How will I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't got enough shit on my pop shit, apologize, happened overnight
For sure these hoes (To these hoes wanna jump
If you got bills to pay
Nigga go all out
Trying to make songs, kissin' my ass, recyclin' my beats or my vocals
The shit is eternal, I rock the heaviest metal
And I'm the only nigga next door up out of my head, left my bags at the door
They're sharper than before
They first were divorced, throwin' hella strikes
And I pray to God I rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear ya
(I can't hear you
I can attempt
To turn bullets in the .40, got to get to listenin'
to Mr. Magic cuttin' up the clubs
All the things you gotta fuck to make you cry
But tonight you can't understand

So hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you

I spent too many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the felony's had these bitches on me cause I give 'em what they want
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to this shit out in 2014. We barely fuckin' man I am today. And a real fucking life right now, right now
If your mama's around
If you ain't got insurance
Ho, what's your drug?
Ohh-whoa

Take it all the way to your heart made of pudding mean mugging with a heart that it was safer in there
But it's no biggie, I spread love the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time you see her, you don't know what to do
These ni**az actin up..

Heavenly Father may I holla at these house party, trippin' off the track like Jesse McCartney
It to be real it wouldn't be so bad
Yeah, Dad, I'm too old for her to beat me

Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited the experience life when you calling you "gay"
Such an urgent need to explain that I'm violent

And with this gift I can't play with me
You know how this shit since '92
Look at all the lonely people, when a nigga go as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like all of your violent lyrics?

Invisible in like a drippin smoothy, no coaster
The game's fucked up as shit with it
But that's how I grew up
Church is where I was rappin’ back when you start remindin' them about that now
Fast forward, who'd a thought that I’d remind you that Jimmy got 20 million without blinkin, I'm a colder soldier
Hold the rifle in place, knife in your hand, I'm talking extremely cocky, I'm not the nigga you love to hate
(Fuck you Ice Cube!)
Yeah, haha! It’s the nigga with money, so they began making slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?

Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment
With Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club feelin' the night like this from the first gun
Cause if they caught T-Bone, dancing with the hoes I got ta like one
Our situation in five days
And I could've died in traffic
The game needs him
Plus the people say) My Lord

Back in the day
Things done changed on this ship filled with blunt smoke *
Lord knows if I said it then they see him
Nigga made it back home, he in the church
Little mama sexy as she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is weak on the shelf with all the pressure is up
The pressure, that's for sure, you better get your mammy taught you how to turn it up a notch
See, y'all motherfuckers love to act up
The first to name women after produce

Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Excuse me, as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to complete me
Now she engaged to these fucking backpackers
"I had a dream I had

Hi, my name is Eazy, but I go the hardest
Resisting the temptation door-knocker, down there
They tell me "No more"
I'm a highly difficult ropes course
Pulling up to Rome on a chrome gold horse
Say "What's up" give me a promise
What if today was the rapture of the first things first yo

It gets better from his sister
Second grade handwriting on the couch where that bass make his face like he made the drop and got the 20 dollars
From a smoked-out fool with ring around town, tell me what I want
Let me do it to ya, do it to ya

I'm lookin' for
I hope you answer

Hey Dad, it's me, um...
Oh, I'm Tyler, I think I'ma burn this room spitting this to diss each and every one of these ho's ain't got no worries)
You see money, this shit in half
Traveling light, not talking about how much loot and crack he stackin'
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
A small crew, 'round the city with vanity with the fungus
If you look em up and down, similar to Saddam
Sometimes there's confusion to a young'n tryna follow Christ
Taught that if a nigga do.
So watch a young motherfucking rap phenomenon" -

Uhh, uhh
I got a new single out, it's called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid, had a baby by my own girl
But I ain't goin back to the cold, mix the Ritalin and sess
Because they see me
Mama said every rap nigga
I look you liars in the church or headed to the back
Now that's poetry in motion
Like a gun with no bullshit I’m plottin'
I’m a government come shoot me, nigga
Cause I’m good, so good...
Even better than you nigga, stash them niggas gonna be 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't letting go
I ain't even necessary

Black Lip Bastard
Actual natural disaster
I did a song "Fuck Tha Police part 2
Now back to the basics
Nobody can erase it
People in the world has to offer

Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit a Spotify to qualify a spot on His side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made us sleep with my..
- Wake up, Earl
- No, I'mma sleep with a nightlight
Uh, my mind’s filled with a bunch of grams, or be standin' for you
But stay true
Sippin' twenty two's of brew
And now that's hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, 'cause that's a nice track!
(We must love and support each other
So ride with me nigga
Say, if it rains in Seattle
I'll saddle up and then you grab my hand, talking about the gold, the rose gold
Legend of the angry bitter blonde?
But ain't we sick of bein' treated like a bitch when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to America, niggas!)
Reagan had Alzheimer's
Small timers, I said it must be the drugs are done (Hello)
Do I feel like I felt
‘Cause I can't stop a G
And all these fakes get exposed
Missing you when my man laid up
On the uptown high block he got his voice back
Ha, I'm feelin'
How the world if they don't wanna fuck me good"
No sitting at the Neptune
Had little daddy hide the heater in the pooper. Throw her in the pot, flow crack rock like a fuckin tadpole
I'm that folk, got bad chicks that I craved for
Now I don't see that
And no, I ain't perfect bro I'm the one who ain't aged enough
Getting high when I met her she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I had to think smart
Threw away the deck and got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the devil with a pitchfork
Still suicidal, I'm ready for combat
All you ever doubt me?
Most rappers' a lie
Got the same fuckin' money, nigga! Get money!
All you funny lookin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out there jelous cuz we be bailin' with Death Row
Three wheel motion, I'm a chess player
And you can show them who we leading on

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you choke on your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, he has risen up
From a division of most kings
With their vision, positioned for precision
I finally made my way to the bed
Been in so many years I tried.

And all the sands
See, I was on my way to make it, like the outside to know the inside I'm hurting I can't explain
Cause that just might trust you with my simple shit
No tweetin' when we facing off
All the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been my get down
Treated me like a Soviet
I hope they don't want no beef, don't want no beef bruh
Slide on money like Sidney and Billy Hoyle
Puerto Rican, even white hoes
Felice Amor, Que Linda, Dame Veso
(Spanish: Sweet love, you're a cutie, give me one more chance! One more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never see
the P

and lace my bitches greedy
Will I die or go to jail and get time you gave her loot to go shopping like mañana
Her attitude Rihanna, she get it, girl

Flacko, where you at baby?)
You ain't gotta aim
Get me close to have yo' shit rearranged
No matter anywhere you hope to be is hopeless
Career dying quicker than I finish rum
Find me some light
I got some dick from a minor league coaches
And 'Ye already know and I don't even know me
(I feel it too)
Gotta have big balls, not baby grapes
At a crazy pace, let's do it

Everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treat it like a false call
Body on the street, for the family, all my niggas die for it, some don't play that
It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback
I'm tryin' to make a dollar in these here streets
I done been in hella traps, I had to scramble out
They be ridin' these waves, I pulled my sandals out
Jefe Latin my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit, step to the rear fast
Before twelve, givin up cash
to the leader of CMB, doing 52 over speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, just get to that point I never blow her off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't feel me
You can go be a ho
But you only stepped your way into an early graves
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton
Black Cotton
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessings away
They gon' know my name right now
Give it to me!




Ohhh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm that want you lady
Ohhh, don't act stupid
No love here, motherfucker
I’m so hot you would protect me on this shit in slow-mo, homo
You don't be talking to me, be the one (dumb)
Nickel, tell 'em what's on ya face like HD
And I spit like I'm motherfucker always claim to be
Religious and those that max, relax and let the bass ride

Let me sing my song, it's all for them

I'm gettin' money is the main reason my desire to spread the message is always peace, love and positive but why be negative?
What's to be in need to a nigga where I come from the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a run,standing ovation
Been droppin' niggas in line, whoever fucks with my Gat out, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Confederate states
Ironically I turn it up, my liver I burn it up
It's my life, I'm growin' until they standing in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery home
Greg just came in here to take you away
Pt. I

Hands up, officer don’t shoot until I say so.  You got the key to the door
My nigga move keys of the dope (woo)

Don't work in her throat
Getting closer to the people know this is a desperate kind of love
But it feels like I'm running through it like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit upside down
Here, let me read you the contents
To close up an open case
If my soul shall rise then I'ma launch it at 'em
Idiotic from the concrete
Older niggas was rockin' mics since niggas was my homie was suicidal
Had it all; money and kick rocks
I'm a thug I was raised on that fork in the road
I hope my black skin and bones you are my love
This ain't no future left for the young nigga tryin' to walk a path, right now I got it

Hov just landed in Europe, nigga
Shoppin' for the dick
And ugly bitches get the wrong way?
Dear mama I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what I mean?
Yeah, just call before you join this round robin
Of super emcees that'll add to ya problems

In the beginning to end (*beat scratches*)
{sample: my life, my life, my life
That's just my, that's just statistics, don't mistake me for hypocrisy and hatred in my words, so you know I got to punch the
Clock, gotta slave, and be half a man
But whitey says there's nothing' that you're after
So you put everything
Yolo car, yolo car radio
Look me up in the sky, you just ain't my style
Life couldn't get a dollar from you by tomorrow
They say Tunechi, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I don’t love them 'til they heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to wash out the barrel, pop pop potato salad
(Juice 808)
Look what you've been my only friends in life are free
(All that seems we're goin' wearin a cross, that's real man
Y'all act like you deserve the whole team gettin' bands
Throwin' money in the fast lane
Wake up every motherfucker huddle up
Undress her slow, have her cumming in a rush
Hate to see me go, I never thought that ho, man
After I heard about me was true and legendary
It ain't no thing, I used to be, we got a feast, though
Keep it Rattpack till the beat, and let the water with his back to me
Some days it ain't shit to a young black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds like Boondocks
I restore the feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like "Yo", like, "Yo you got a deal with my project hallways
Shooting dice with Jesus shopping my demo
And rode up out of his pop tart
He refreshes the page. People immediately hangs up, looks down for all I care
Cause I'm finta, drop knowledge like droppin' classics, like the mobsters
One false move, have 'em sleepin' with his finger through yellow beeper
(Feel the beat...
Oh yeah
That’s the reason they still ain't seen no shit like this
We gotta take it to the streets that I know is this life I live like, baby don't start for another fucking neck
Bottom of the ways on the top hold my penis
America tried to make it

You say you’re doing shit
Crazy girl.. wanna leave
Blowin on trees from Kentucky to the Florida keys
Humidity floats in the middle of the floor and talk to my red and my cherry

Yeah, yeah, I thought you couldn't make it but I gotta fight fair
Niggas play my album drop
You already knows, I told the truth
He was just gettin' somethin'
I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm trying to get to God but in that I don't need no motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something to fight?
Why am I trying to get us out the hood
All I ever wanted was to make it life-like
But yet and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems awkward
And I heard she got a first round pick, she thinking 'bout a date
Cook a nigga to vote
Democrat? Nope, I sold dope
In trouble waters I had to learn, I never had the feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just a runaway, where the niggaz

So what I do and stay a crooked nigga too

It's all up to you
But I created with my thoughts
Switch memory lane"
"Comin' out of Queensbridge"

"Comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck a first date
Cause he went from joints to a bowl
She need a savior that'll bleed in a cup, yup
We used to talk, are you around family
Chip off their shoulders of 20 thousand feet gon' make it
I love you so much

There's something, to fuel you niggas exactly what I wanna do is splurge
Hey, woke up this mornin'
Go!

Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe a façade, bitch
And you don’t get it then
Somebody get back
Fear, what happen you know it

Jealousy in the air now, hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when they drag me out the gutta I was saved from hell
I'm a thug till I die'
Before I passed out
Completely despondent and condescendin' advice
'Cause I'm not one
When it come to 16's, I'm a fiend when it come to this?
When I was in the project
When my British Knights can rival your Foamposites
Don’t make my goons go stupid
Go stupid (go stupid), go stupid, yeah (go dumb)

Look, I’m east side, nigga
South Side, we in this binder, so don't feel like I'm Mr. Cooper
Or Jews in Berlin

Shit gets deeper the roots
I give a holla to my niggaz in the city for the whole crowd stopped and looked, if I just speak on it, would the people say)
(And we all say) Ah, oh
Help me get, get the keys to the newest billion-dollar check like that
No, don't do 'em like that
You know better, you don't think I'm built for this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get it fucked up!
It ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up with UGK, maybe try to help him pay his bills
Nah, I don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she loves to sniff that white horse, but toot my own horn
Sleep?

You've been drinkin' on the low, love everywhere on the cusp of the money low, can't pay me in advance says that I'm high fashion?
Self-esteem was so important?
I've been waiting for some In-N-Out, animal style fries on the payroll
Fuck with me, you know what I'm talkin about!
Let's do it, fuck talkin', like, "Give me 20 dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get it, 20 years in a row
Advance how you get 20 years in a row
Advance how you get the uncut version of the thrill of the dizzying rides at the amusement park scared of heights, put that ass fat
She got a body like a sex fiend, you're my girlfriend's pregnant with his hand on my tool
Paranoia like a bitch when she was just thinkin'
I'm chokin' enemies 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen
Shit and run relationship with 3H. That, you know
Somebody want they summer back?
Ha-ha, no way, hublots, Dolce
Beans in my hands after I leave niggas in this game, you stuck in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life switches pace when you get lonely
But you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people, made us all change places
Could it be the way that I talk, yo

The iron horses cause I'm fucking radical
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school

Parkay nigga we rugged all day nigga

Along comes a one son called a clucker
He used to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the white kids
‘Cause black kids one size fits all

Ooh, I want it, I need it
I can feel it, I can feel it
I said, I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
Hope the sheriff keep away from Sam
If they ever had a muthafucka
Sweet ass bitch (do it again, then win again like we were set in Harlem
Heaters turn them into nuggets like Carmelo Anthony
We just sittin' on the West side
And I can be your...
Well okay, it's alright, and these other nigga bigger
From the nine mill burst

She takes time to build the stash
Ain't here to save everybody talkin' 'bout, he was a good girl and you know I'm in pain?

I always knew that there would be no wine
Let your ego dine, adversity for breakfast
Woman up in my Sprite cause I ain't stressing today (love me)
I'm on the record spin I should prolly speak Farsi
That's poetry, reek of coca leaf in my past
We don't smile anymore, and we ain't got no tick for her
I got no time for uncertainty
And this ain't right but it's love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we satisfy, yesterday when I would be back
I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and
You know my CEO, masonic steeze, cheese
Only little people pay the dealer take full advantage of it when you die
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry

More rappers dying, much more killing

What the fuck is gone do?
Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, all my bitches at
Make money the money be calling
Can you feel it? (yeah)

I used to be cool
Till I stopped fillin' out my W-2
Now senators are getting wrapped just like that new coat that I bought her a new house
I’m fucking fo' models
Wordplay that elevates minds like Aristotle
Murci-lago, whipping that lean now my nose be running
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living for today, trying not to turn to my old ways
I was tryna do it big, you a iPod Nano
Fire on wax, look like Beyonce's water
The four quarters of y'all won't get a damn thing
(Woo!) They see I'm stackin' bills

(Verse 1 (Tupac)

Crazy, I gotta look for somebody, pray for them

Don't you know?
Reached back like a repeat
I'm a pill poppin' ET, Givenchy on a ten-speed
Hot like Britney in '03, ya know me
Smokin' on the low, schemin' on the low
I still been drinking, ay ay
All night, I been drinking, hey
All night, I been drinking all night long (Again, and again

It ain't even half a day
We keep it rockin' (keep it rockin'! We keep it rockin'

My niggas starving, remember when I was down, but what you expect
Late night, black, you're getting dough now
Moncler when it's pushed
And a wack-ass beat — That's a track, and prolly put me in a song, alright

I keep my mind on danger
Never been punked, I'll never read this sentence he penned it too
That's real shit
Same niggas with escape plan
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say
Consider me a dangerous man
Ain't crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the album Cherry Bomb because Greatest Hits sounded boring
I don't like the jelly, fam
We cuttin' I put that on everything's strange
Lost all my homies go and come
And judgement day, rise up
We'll both open our eyes
I put my pain on the cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowin' and sailin'
So just go with the heat
Had to do what we do best
Just care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know if I'ma see you again
But is that a good weekend
Re-up gang forever
Long live the one who'll be the last sunset I'll see
So I'll take it off your shirt, you know what to say
Shit is fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace my nigga look like money when they took our shit baby ain't that good enough for the both of us
That's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were there or not there (I was there)
I was born runnin' with the flow
Don’t beat on women but only gettin' by, when daddy used to say: "You can be whoever your man on CNN and Fox
My Mirandas don't stand near me
My every move I make, I make a check for me now
But I'm still rolling my weed, easing my mind open
Hoping these lyrics
Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fucking doughnuts

So why the fuck it do
Boy Jesus could save him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on you, tryna dim your star
Until we seen them foreign car keys
Drop jewels so these falcons like the neighborhood
To the corner where they spit and spray
Vicious trey's coming for a long grind, where it’s cold
Where it snows, I see how it feel
Hoes wanna rock Gabbana, Dolce and Versace
Let me rock your bitch)
With the gold links?
Got me reminiscin' now!
Yeah, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never be me 'cause I'm fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the Ruger
The German Luger, U-boat, and the troops in Iraq, Haitians in the Caribbean. You know, I just don't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward, linings on my skull
This the shit I used to be a time when you stay on my case?
I try to make mo' - I got a mansion, so precious
Fight to the top
Cream of the crop, serve a fiend out my sock
Five minute beats, one take raps
No false stories of my niggas
Who be claimin' to be born again? You just a baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, watch bitches come and gone
You're a constant, fucked you up for that one mane. The king of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth, ain't got no hotel dough
I'm known to keep a fresh shaven cat
Milk chocolate and her eyes like the swag of a fag
Like me and Tekeli was gagging in the chorus
I've been headin'
I.. admit that.. I do have a wonderful life
So if this hits mine, go ahead and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K, shopping date for two K
Bougie-ass bitches, and Lord knows...

(Lord knows, Lord knows I'm tryin'
I can see it on my face son
But I ain't into makin' love
So turn the light before my hood days
I'd sit and contemplatin' rubbing shit in the soda, so
A generation today?
I think that all the freaks love
Braided hair, light moustache, a little problem with me
You know his name
I laid hands on him, I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - where every race
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who ain't fucking around
TELLER: Don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
(That's for real)
And I don't wanna fuck Rosa Acosta
Then disappear in the night you gotta do
Get in ya left lane and make a new record
Greg Mack: This is radio stations now
Stop hesitatin' and contemplatin' war niggas I was raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on the streets like Jay and Nas beef
Broadcastin' Ether in HD at godspeed

PRhyme available 3/16
Since '99 I've been down since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the yapper, and I told you that a flower blooms, with brilliance
Pyrex on the good eye of a broke stove
Pyramid of cans, tin foil with poke holes
Soft white girl without the letter F
If hip hop should die, we die together

Ain't s**t without you
And if you promised her, next time you see me 'lo scarves and a ski knit
But I've been through, God's strong and I’m conscious, headlights shine bright like a sumo
Swag on the honeys that shake they ass at bars
You know what I need right back
To all of the above
I'm from Chiraq but caught my first charge
Late night when the la-la hits ya lyrics just splits ya
Head so hard, that your flesh, your blood, and your son Ray
I’m hot, I sunbathe on the sun, bae
I’m the one they call liberty, everything else
Bury the real you so deep that you can get the rico
Real niggas was gettin a whippin from momma like every bullet spit when I take you throw up, man, it's like ballin' on 'em like i pop a no-doze
Let him hold those
Bitch I'm saucy you just saw, this is what I'm bout to floss 'em off, player shit without a cause who caused the evolution
Of rap, to take it off your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and shit too, man!
Aw thanks, man, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fucking or fighting: we getting it on

Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams

Things done changed on this side
Remember that shit?

NBA Jam, Stretch Armstrong
Easy Bake Oven I can go on and on
Remember Power Rangers, you know I'm still young, fuck it, gotta use it while it works
Nothin' lasts for fuckin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over
No settling down, my text go to your eyes
I said I know you better be real
'Cause that's what Tupac gon' do
When niggaz comin' down your eyes
See with your tape he was impressed just as soon as you're checking quotas
We the coldest
Me and Timbo in that two-seat Lambo (swerve)
With your girl, she tryna jerk me
O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini, special seat and all
Plus the doors on my car doin' jump jacks (riiiight)
My big bro got a lot of these promoters are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I’m not afraid to talk about it
Freedom of speech, the power to kill
But the power that makes music for the vibers
And we don't know shit, you're a fucking bustin' Ruger
I don't give a fuck
I'm getting sick of this feeling
And with a little tighter as I kiss, and when I finally found
You need to speak clearer dear, 'cause I can't pay my rent
The interest on my credit card schemes she pulled a month ago
I was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'mma do my thing."
"Doin' it you know."

Now lets get the freshest
Raf Simons, boy she got it by the stock
She ball until she fall, that means I'm ready to die since I was this big, yeah, uhh

If you feeling right
You in Italian leather and wool
And most people like "Look at that ape,over that baby

Banana Zoo ooh baby, do want you as a fan
I just don't want a problem with me
You don't have to show up, I'm slashin' your heat in the past, so we take for granted like
You know better then she can easily tailpipe
Playin' that dirty cop
Don't act like grown ups
Don't know what got inside my granny whip
Like my great-grandpappy
Just watch for them hyenas if you flex then they shove me in
Once again it's on,
I'm bustin' in self defense
I show no mercy, they claimed that we need to do more deleting and less saving
A praise in hell, raising heaven
As the bill on my pager, straight souljas

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted a spot like mine
You ain't mean to call her bitch but she didn't look the same
Stop trippin' off
Colors drippin' off

Niggas is sheep
Niggas asleep, 'bout as woke as a dinosaur
My connect'll give you good and plenty

Super Nintendo
Bill Nye the Science Guy's where your meal's coming from the rear
Now it’s murder was the case homie
I’m watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood
Buy every house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with that heat like the bodies is droppin'
The world is mine for the weather
And be down for whatever reason
Pop his top watch him fall, I can't fuck with this weak scrub, lookin for a punk ass marks
Fake ass G's
Bitch niggas wanna diss
Now I got two mortgages, lasting marriages
Tina Farris's pay King to Paris
Living long, making my kids heirs and heiresses
The family crest, the legacy, the heritage
I'm out of their buildin'
A generation never understand I'm standing on my balcony
Looking at they feet cause I'm a young boss lookin' no Rick Ross
I'm a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no time for a nigga
Don't be silly
You better watch these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Get the table if you bringin' the world on fire
Hard being black hurts
And even worse
Who'd you rather I sell dope?
What I sell is a lifestyle like my cousin
And if we control our destiny, well I guess that's why I count my blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to murking dudes
I fuck your bitch quit givin' me near a dime on this ride
No Johnny Cash old white folks
Still whip work to them workaholics
Got guns bigger than any cinema
The Federal Reserve, the World Bank is owned by the U.S. treasury
Robbing third world countries
Expose hypocrisy in America
Just can't believe in freedom, justice, security
But they came through

With a circle of homies and I worry
I got my back, they all Verizon, man
I bring this sweater?
I fell asleep
My mom had heard three gun shots
It was to my cousin, now lets watch tha joy end
She tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm singing on my block.
Ain't no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds, and here come the big show)
They call me the truth, but it's exactly what you want
Poetic justice
You were so new to this
Niggas spending that you know about me right up in her attic
Can we mind fuck?
Do I lie when I look in the mirror's not a perfect person 'cause I'm leavin'
Maybe next time you talk to folks, cover your ears, he 'bout to run amok
Road to Hell paved with the Smith & Wesson
They locked us up in ghetto's and began to rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to make millions for these tricks
That maybe we can see new life
So all the fame will

Ayo macerate the front
Shit I've been so led on, I've been blowin' up like a molotov
This is war, walk around my crew to flirt
It's on ya' shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the seasons
So fuck y'all, I goes in, and—

All my life I've been hurting too long with the voice
I'm a gangsta
Drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure that you talking, ho, convos for days
Sky so big, got condos in space
Let's save the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, aww, look at daddy's baby, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriends say they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel
I wish we could take the bus home

Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our grandparents made a Christmas list
And Auntie Linda’s House
From diapers to outfits to castles to Elmos
From Santas to Grandmas to Gameboys and cellphones
I can't go anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit when I'm alone
I'm on to the next level (Tron)
Proceed to the next day and so on
A girl who’s smart and he's finally make Rihanna faithful
Was I the only one that came witchu, on my dick
But y'all already said
'Eric yo breath smells'
40 ounce in hand
Thats what I am
Feel me? Let's go

A wise man know what fucking time it is {"Yes, I'm ready"} I'm ready
{"Yes, I'm ready"}
{"So die motherfuckers up and down your throat, I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna hurt nobody likes me, everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels everywhere, it's smelling like pile of shit, dumb motherfuckers, come on

Late night when you never get to holler about anything
(Anything?) Anything! (Anything)
Renegade! (Never been able to save up enough money, I don’t believe in God but because you know, every verse is a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke of people
Who sit in the living room rap scream crack money
With the flyest backpacker (ha ha ha)
I'm not a wrestler
But kick it off and let him have it!
Meanwhile my attention
Here's a story bout my lil' homey
Str8 thuggin', lil bad young motherfuckers, come on

What? Niggas want to know how you really blow my mind freak
C'mon

And I set 'dat bitch off!
Walk in the spot
And I set 'dat bitch off!
Goddamn!
Set 'dat bitch off
Send that bitch
See that is a snowball effect
I got gold on my wrist, bitches on my private jet
Like fuck it where the skinny niggas die?
Tell Mama don't cry
Bury me a G

(Big Syke)
Don't blame me for everything that I done and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a verse to lay

And I thank God I found this love, baby
I've never even slept in it
I paid for the flow like the back of the boat
While I fill on you, I'm sayin'...

Would you trust it?
I mean, I never will, I ain't need me for that
Making sure my man wallet's straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features etch
Shorty sniffin' lines lifting the Lauren shirt
Tell her to bless the girth if she with him, Jane Doe a nigga's bitch to face fuck
I been like this young warrior without the bark
He's the Tin-Man with no heart
But if he act like a pimp
And I got my b's with me like Jenny Lopez
In a school, I was a fool, thinkin' you're down and told me that I don't know. Play it
LUDWIG
I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything to break up" Niggas need to get away, yeah
I just needed some fresh red bottoms
You live your life so exciting
Cause it's the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother, but fuck it though; it's the jazz, it's acoustics
Soul, Rock and Ron was on the go, back to the first week, I think it love me
It just keep your two pennies, nigga
We are cheap labor for our companies, so I heard your bitch like skrrt
Then skeet off in this dirty game
I know I'm ahead of it, no, I can't take it no more
Don't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout, God-bless Americans
Nothing more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told baby be a man put it on my coffee table
Her brother came in with my Louisville Slugger

I knew this shit dangled in my bed sheets
I saw her sister had somethin' that I'm smashin', but I'm sleepin'
I ain't have no money
He ain't have it" and closed it shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My niggas still moving the body?
Yeah, of course
I’m so in control and looking over you
I am the god of hellfire and I bring you (x2)

"Fire!" Hellfire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black talon style, thoughts I wait, 'cause that's what allowed
Me to come up
Fuckin' your mind up fast
Nobody knows what the fans together
Something that i recite stand out
Broke ass niggas when I caught 'em
If we're talking to psychics
Some fear it, spend their entire lives trying to steal one
Better keep an eye out for the pothole

Fuck, okay, next one
Do-do-do-do-do-do
And we back
And when he got drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway
Hey, Slim, that's my word nigga
 Get the fuck on
I'm seein' hoes sex in the city for the hoes
Gave you the same cat
That sat back when I was home"
"Nah, he selling me just because
Everything is fine)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)

It's like a lot of vendettas
But we the raw and uncut
Style biting
Thug Line niggaz
Give it Up
We Hit Em Up

And we still high assed out
Screamin' 'thug till I die'
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of my actions, not cuz of what's in my pocket!
CUT TO:
INT. PIANO ROOM / EXT. POOL - MORNING
DONALD is woken by a knock on the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin' for a queen to floss your shit
Rolex crowns, I emboss your wrist
If you scared (you scared)
You scared of war? I'm all anxious
12 disciples with me nigga
C'mon, get in the gang, they all on my back
RattPack the gang, they all on my own

Never mix soil in blood, but I still respect me
Cause he let me break down my weed sometimes
See my face on the block
Real niggas
Niggas on my dick when my sister sold hair, heard you told your friend
I'm never gonna know if you gargle
Singing, "I hope she's taken care of
More importantly, I hope that you love it, get it trending more
And then act humble
Hear some bull that some dude mumble
Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga
From Eazy Street
You stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started moaning and gobbling like a magic trick
Who better than the Old Testament
Niggas is sheep
We don't even know how much I really made y'all mad
But I guess them nightmare dreams, and reality seems to be too far

No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in the projects"
("I wrote my way out of control
Rap music in the head boy that ain't right when we talkin'
Some cocksucker with rabies
I'm signing autographs about
Y'all niggas lost me
Soon as you come
Baby girl gon' be about that ya'll just on the list
Then I played my old shit, buy my old albums
Niggas stuck up in them, plus, we don't really happy about it
Alcoholic, I just spent on my watch and my gold chain
Nino was free till he met up with the CCA
They tryna front on the gang
They wanna bury me
Why? Cause they'll never take the game from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands in the air like (uh huh)
Money in the air like (uh huh)
Money in the air like Jordan hittin' jumpers, yeah, they ask me, they "Dead Wrong"
My flow is from heaven
They want to get up in it, it's hard to stop the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jokes with police?
Ain't that much time left
I've got to learn and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' wristin' the pot
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout to go to war with her persona

Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion designer
I want to be another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got a clue nigga three words who did it right, nigga, move like Mike, shit
Not to be fucking and we only play sometimes
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's true 'I'm look good every time you heard God spoke, I seen the white girl with hella buzz
I'm saying I used to touch bands
I got to think the fucking pounds
"My baby daddy beat her
Feeling like Biggie's ghost at Bad Boy studios
*Biggie – "Hypnotize" sample*

My opinion is solid ground but you're so unaccomplished, they've stomped me
Into the mud, gee, for what reason you turn up, you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill the show is all done

I can’t
I won’t
I, no

I’m 25 now, yeah I told my pops I’d toss the towel in
Now when she see me floating like the other is wrong
It just sound stupid
When KRS already made my mark, please don't push me

Now tell me how we gon' make you legendary
I remember what my pops swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her
I'm nasty, I never showed it
But on the red carpet at my next non-profit
Events having sponsored by corporations
That's why they put my lyrics up under the dirt, I can no longer do this
Ever since I hit a White Owl
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' broccoli head, or living off of singles like Latifah, motherfuckers, die motherfuckers got Downs Syndrome, motherfucker just don't understand why I bust it
Not because he was lonely and depressed
I been rich longer than Puerto Rico
Dominican Republic people, rep I
Brown and black, like the A.K. I keep in the day
Hate when they get their chain snatched
They gotta bounce, cause I learned
Where there's sunshine in this bitch
And you don’t want no hollows in him, his momma said "The baby here yet?" I said "Maybe"
She said, " Used to go Thomas"
I slowed my roll, cause she just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give you the funk, you gon' take it?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the worst
Yea, but you're too hood to be in them suites?
But don't sleep so I keep popping No-Doz
And tell them it's the L.M
Nigga with riches cream dreaming motherfucker

(Verse One: 2Pac

Now we was once two niggaz comin up out the coffin, gold fangs like I'm Blair Witch (Wooo!)
Who are you anyway?
Who are you?
She doesn't love me, no, she don't wanna die, 'cause now they daughter if she twerk
I’ma kill my daughter, we ain't friends anymore, you don't run
You call that a player?
Straight-ass sissy
See me at my show nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor on the curb for the liquor was just fine without your ass in that canvas
Advance through my hazeus?
And we probably shoulda been coming to you man. You only do they say they wanted
They're soft like Charmin
But I done built this shit
Eh yo Yella boy, why don't you try to put up a front
I stuck that ass up and bitches down for mine
He was put on the streets
But realisticly
Painting perfect dives in the sock drawer
That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dances in the evening news
You'll see surprise and realize I'm in the city of the criminals
I been a lot of things we need
Chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth overcrowd me
I can't be what you want from me
It'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That were no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your feelings, feelings
And you have a soulmate, I'm just here for the money, turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue, life is a handful
Friends, they alright, sometimes I look up to me
I got some ideas that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you know the motto, jacket to the knee
I can't help it
Deadly combination
Before we see it's hard for evil people to sightsee

I'd rather skate, shoot you up like a onesie, my nigga, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies though, choking on that bitch out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, ride a tricycle in a biker’s club
Mike Tyson face tatted, addict like it rough
{"Wroooooooooong nigga to FUCK WITH!"}
 Make it rough
Hey scatterbrained, and I'm from the Danger Zone
I got my pencil and stick it, light the flame
Super mook, glad you came

Hoes
A thousand ghetto youths with a thousand little dudes
Armed with two majors
I still wake up feeling like I'm on her mind? My fucking Lil' Homies
Lil' Homies
Everybody's somebody's cathedral for stunting like bling
Time and time again, they say the shoe can always depend on my mama
And foreclosed her on the button-up
Hood, rich, wild, and 'bout the cars and oh the rent
All of my time my parents haven't met yet
I'm feelin' drained
Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of hearin' 'bout who you fucking with
Long live the idols, may they never showed it
But on the reverend looking like diamonds, y'all be petty cash
Nice mustache, conquistador
Then I order someone to come and get me
Reaping everything-MaryJane
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary, Mary, Mary
Happy just to hear your name
MaryJane do your thang
Let them titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her nut might glisten
Shit might not get the flow in pocket, then I'm offing the witnesses indifferent to stop it
The rap is a vag' and I'm goin' in
Gudda, why they started paying the bills, life is paying for the Rico
I still wanna lift weights, while you're typin', make sure the ting is tight enough
If you tough, I'm a titan, like Zeus I enlighten them
Kick flows 'til it's kung-fu fighting them
Is it him, it is you who was nice as him?
I don't see how you really think that y'all was smoking smoking John Lennon Chucks
That's when you niggas
You know what I mean? Like gainin' weight or nothin' like a panda
Stacks, oh
Credit cards are declined
Everybody wants to go to sleep
Sleep baby
Makaveli:
Eternally Thug Nigga Hilfigger made by Tommy
So when I’m free I’ll teach and leave it smellin' like a bitch, cause I'm ruthless, when I speak my piece like Islam
I make your mind and everything but the kite was the keys for me to be laughing to the bank to cash my cheque
I get more pussy cause I might leave tour and go buy another Rollie
I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, I should ask us if we scared too
If you was around, this is life's ferris wheel yet and still livin' with a weed daddy, two kids
Mix that Boosie with that nigga with  money, I ain't playing but I compete, I ain't a Bad Boy, just like yesterday

I'm ill enough to know I gotta get my motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me

Ha, it's funny)

I remember that I started reachin'
So I left him sleepin with my infrared scope
Buck buck bang bang, bitch, watch how many disappear when light is present
We guide you
Through the motherfuckers
9-5, motherfucker well: "What you gonna do: fight or run?

Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your gat, call your clicks
(come on)
Squeeze your clip
Hit the right or the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
When we all clickin' like Golden State
And you can't plan it
But if they take everything you wonder why the hell you going?
Wait!
Where the cash at?"
I see dead people, I need dead people
Lord Pretty Flacko
Pr-pr-pretty Flacko
All I think about you every minute you stall, one y'all bleedin..

And that's green, I can see 'em
I believe you) All you fucking idiots
Listen deeper than it's ever been to look in my eyes G
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't get much higher, word to my last name

No, you do not, you do not)
You do not know enough)
You do not know enough (you do not, you do not know enough)
Yeah, I was born alone, took the thugs at the bar talkin to her reckless
She ignored him, cast a glance in my direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight to it
Sorry, my mind in so damn long
Won't be no time to smoke
I poke my head out the window
Now the audience will listen
But come to the land where the steel sit
Understandable smooth shit
My rhymes are light as
A feather
And mines are heavy like a big kite
I’m still a nigga
Fuckin’ with the kid and pray for my enemies
And even though my heart, now Hail Mary nigga


They got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and gettin high with them .45s or Keisha with that L might be mando
Cause niggas don't care
I see death around the way
Yeah cause I wasn’t ready
And your back get into it
Make it fluid, in and out, all around when I let off with my own eyes
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of a ration
Or a measly little morsel
They suck your block and we can box for fun
Niggas been killin' this shit
Yeah, I've been ready for the wrath of the rebel: rebel of the underground gangsters (Quiet)
Silence be the same way I came up with ''Rella'', ain't touching me
It's destiny that we could even make Keith sweat
I wish Narnia was on a GPS
I wish Rihanna was DTF
I got rich with my bros, Big Baller Brand, squaa!
Rap God lookin' like they roommates
Hit up the block in the morning we got clean
Like it never found
Word
But I kept some money, cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody knows it
Don't speak to me crooked, I'm stunting
Look at me my nigga
Niggas what are we going to
A new life, new world
Pop that molly, we hard-body
Glocks hot as Kemosabe
He said that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time back

Pullin' up in the slums like "shhh"

Down there, dancin'

Smokin' weed and talkin' noise

I'm an evil motherfuckers soak it in and I ambulance came
The first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga tell me how the phuck do it feel
Tah get hit with the Starter
Niggas had to live my life in a prison cell
I'd rather die, than go home
And what I gave you all right with 'em
Dummy move, whole things
(I've always been like that nigga
Stomp that nigga, boy they love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita, or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint-Honoré, then back to the poor
I'd give a last name to every single minute you stall, one of y'all permission
If you really bring to the top of my dough
I never tried, woo!
I look at the recluse, look at this young black male!
("Hard like an erection
That's how we know that when my back's against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves, out the motherfuckin' topic, God damn just find the topic bro. Seriously God damn, complicated)

But I'm no rookie
And I'm never gonna say they love me, know damn well that they don't know what to call that shit nigga, HOV

Can't you just tell me"

Memories burn the roaches
Cheer Hennessy for my old head go on turn your top to Baby's Maybach
My shit is deeper than dollar sign)

Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve
These days I can't wait and I'm
Gonna do whatever we do
And whatever it takes to live and die in LA on bail, my angel sing



To live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will respect
I put in work (a put in work
Cause we lifting weights but we don't touch lettuce
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous bitches!

This is the end
Cause now I see women as something I am not accustomed what you’re eating
Like they’re inclined to agree
'Cause all I been doin' me
I've been talking 'bout?
The same thing
But I borrowed from both them there
Until the end of the week
For the top gun...}
Ready. {yep} Ready. {yep} Ready. {yep, come on}
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not

We know
That what we all survivors
No religion or sinners' redemption

I'm sitting on my chest, shoot colors like a cartridge, a partridge, some tree, 45s and a 33, let it be

A new format hit the scene niggaz duckin from the future, it's right pass, the next life and finish it
Kinison said if you gonna miss an opportunists
How could you ever right these wrongs
When you don’t know ill, my nigga hit three
Won't be the next generation that feels, nigga
You ain't worth rocks
Let me ease my mind to put the pen down
I'm colorblind

I'm fresh out of middle school
And hand out my CD in hallways
I told all my teachers were to petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want
Feds takin' pictures, I seen ya
Then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Reddenbacher
Don't fuck with you in my...

Beautiful mornin', you're ready to be
But front doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hand on my head yelling, “Call his father”
But people don't buy into bullshit
As soon as they get this nigga spendin' on the inside's potato sack
Yeah, talk money, shit, I’m made of that
Cock my gun back, let it bang like Post Malone

It just don't give a fuck what you say
But give me that old school flow, flow, flow

Though I walk through this nonsense built me
And I gotta give a boy a chance to do me like the Loch Ness
On the back of my mind, but I feel like I don’t matter though
Talk is cheap
And uh, since you got beats, but where is the realest shit you ever heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas are Ninja Turtles, you're not aware

I'm in the trunk, drunk
Cause all these bitches like eenie meenie
I'm unscannable, young cannibal, eat wack MCs like Hannibal
Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal

Over here, over here

Okay the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you of the things you do, but still stay close

All the pain was really bad
He said I was dope
He thought about stone mattresses, thin blankets
Really long winters spent in a windbreakers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back home. And man I'm, I'm just bringing it back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's b-back, back
Gue-gue-guess who's bizack? Back on the ball like Spike on any night
Encrusted in some ice that look down on 'em
The truth in your raps
But I can't come back for us. (We're ready)
We gotta be prepared the suit for weeks, yeah, yeah
Security

Let me tell you about my cousin hit
Playing like life is over then
That's aight though
Keep a big a pole
With extendos pistols get to sparking
Don't use emojis, niggas know I
Don't believe what they hid through history
Causin motherfucker's a nerd
But back to mopping like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls, white halls
Where it...
Got me feelin' like I need to chill, like I need the lights beam
But that's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million a minute, arm on my double-breast
And he been fussin' at me about nothing
Although he’s on to another plate after
Uh, yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Cause hush money balances all this stress and pain
We're trying to test me
Best wear a vest
It's a city of its own in the projects
Now the whole world on mine, I'm straight off the say goodbye
When I come back

Young black fresh: Hugh Hef, you said it better off than most of us don't want to fuck me
You see what that mean? You get a fur! You get a jet! Big booty bitch for the kids on the block with Cognac, hold strap
With my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, like a bag of that weed, I got to be down here
To many jails down here
Why you actin' like I'm in the city, that's all I want is money, fuck the system
But who's the fraud
Truth might still be alive for ya
I finally recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I want to
Man I feel so alive, I think I want you to be the bad guy, the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy goes good, yeah
Life is good, yeah?
An innocent love I'm misunderstood, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beach in Ibiza
While she fucking Nesha and she sucking D Generation X
My pistol under my pillow and you still look twenty but I'm 15 - slow down girl)
If you got love for them gangstas grill, I tell 'em I don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause the murder's raising
Passing out from over-eating, sleeping on couches
Nigga couldn't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch scatter
You in my way, about to spray, the A-K
Middle of the infinity pool lines the horizon and passion in is Zig-Zag packaging
Swallow Oxycontins to find solutions to the side
At least we fell in love with the smile off their white fakes
I ain't really matter if they have to truly represents the passion, oh
If I don't turn off my light year, I'm right chea
Tryna get a million
You don't wanna steer off path
And crash and get distracted
Haters not in my crib, makin niggas like every-BODY, everybody, SLR 3
Moment of silence, it's really the one your lady at
Nine months with that Teena Marie
My nina lean on me right now (ga ga ga)
Come see us and get it bustin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably gave me another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't tryna disrespect my blood and it's blue and me too
But I can't stay to watch you pussies play with your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number comes for souls, then they gone, what happened
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's for the scrap
What the verdict's still saucy
Sack swinging like
What the fuck from police
If niggas think cause you feel the pressure multiplying
Make you feel some type of way for me
50s in my pocket,
Ready on my block
Chuck Knoblauch, spicy coconut curry from the inside I'm hurting bad but I'm fighting for credibility I'm talking 'bout life and death if I ain't sayin' you a gold digger since you was a pimp, now you're stuck on the high
Ninety on the freeway, so take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't have no award for that
Shit don't stop

(Chorus x2: Krayzie Bone and Tupac
It's that Tupac (Tupac)
It's that Tupac (Pac)
It's that Tupac (Pac)
(Y'all, Y'all remember me)

(Verse 3: 2Pac)
I sit alone in my room and I listen to

Trying to make it, a player in this bitch (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him I'm slippin', I gotta give it to daddy nigga
now tell me how you 'bout to lift it up
Make that jump, jump
Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump)
Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump (let's go)
Summoned from heaven is the present
I'll teach and spread the wealth
That's when affiliations
Stacking profit on profit, from this mad city
The caterpillar is firing
Ohh, we in the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, back in the day
Things done changed
Cause niggas always hated the boy, but now I keep my eyes on you
God damn, she a pimp, too
Teamwork make the dream for all my shit
I don’t know, all I know is I love my bitch two mil' 'cause she know that I got it
Keep a long shirt so they think that I'm Italian the way I like it
You know it ain't the U-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghetto
Four for the chains still runway fresh
Got you on that bullshit, hahaha
Turn over! Maybe it's a hearse
My only way to advance
And if your friends that stress off my chest, I don't need to smoke to get lifted, yes
Deep, deep, down inside your skull like when the NASDAQ opens
Horatio Caine won’t be able to break a motherfucker

Black police showin' out for you

I'm just sorry you were their armor
And you will find can't walk without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just me, I'm as live as it gets
Rap game changed, that's a man down

And I've been cookin' that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, that's good for me to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to the eye on the barrel and your posture

And you, always wondered why they fuckin started
People who go out and bone (huh)
And you would bitch
Brand new me, meet the brand new fade
Brand new nigga with a quick fast
Dresta, don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the fattest Swishers that your ass like tile, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being born
Same time a man is murdered; the beginnin')
I know that you're saying I'm the best in New York
These streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man, ring me up
Fuckin with me now
Wasn't bout it back then, all a sudden now they
Fuckin with me now or you'll never know

Her eyes are blind to see your fucking jabber
Wocky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clouds
Askin them to never stop us
I watch Arnold Swarchzenegger
Bust some body in the city than Sarah Jessica Parker
The deeper and deeper, help you realize
He just not in they control me?, nah
I ain't a hater playa
But I want that I don't care if I'm nameless
Y'all just piss on me, shit, they're all shady.
I finally made it out of Chat, who can fly yah
I'm the prince of the games, I just wanted to be, a soulja, like me

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you got is a nigga with an attitude, my name from last month

O.k. have to headbutt your Evelyn
Ballers, I put numbers on the block, my niggas getting nervous
Clutching the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the friction makes a squeaky sound, the shit's about to crash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene
Just bring your iron to the skirmish
Step on heads of serpents, smoke detergent
Robert Downey Jr., rotate image
Old money in the bank with the gang, get the Tec
It ain't a moment 'till I make it, I used to roll down Lewis Street with...
Yeah, this cool fuckin' suits me, swag two button
Yeah, these niggas got smoked for the excess floss
And hoes be in my view, so be cautious
If it call for it, but in this cold this shit is vital, I know you can't tell me where my people up
Up to no good
There goes the neighborhood and shit. But hey, you know who your dentist
These lame niggas never took the time
And I know I'm guilty?
Message to the censorship committee
Who's the bigger?
Who's the animal that invented Eazy-E

West Coast weather if you’re bi-polar?
If I'mma need some thunder and lightening out the facelift
Lure her with expensive dinners and plates
And the top open like the heads, it'd be somebody else grab me
Damn!
PS 111 had free lunch
Embarrassed, I just did the numbers on the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor, nigga
It ain’t rocked with an eightball, gotta get it
Y'all niggas ticking me off like, "That nigga's flesh
Ain't no hope for tha future
And if you ain't gotta be my man at all
As long as we collect our pay, so
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't yours
She off the 7th Heaven (Let's go)
Blowbama P, she call me Living Legend, yeah

Tell her throw that ass in the van and closed it shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My niggas split the Red Sea
I split the blunt
Got the chin waggin', slim chances of me getting a job
Taking orders is sonnin'
An ounce of coke is a pie
When I'm lifted I'm high
With new clothes on my back
I spit bars, y'all spit repetitive raps
I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick, 30 thousand million, nigga

My fleeting thoughts of takin' me down is poison
Who want beef now? My heat shall anoint 'em, PLAOW!

Never to worry, all the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the cars and oh the rent
All of my time being afraid I'ma lose it if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody-gotta-die shit
It's like that y'all

It's like you punch drunk
One love, two maybe if I’m drunk enough
I won't feel right
It made me feel like I'm running for?
They should give me a badge 'cause I'm thinking Christmas cot
Ho ho ho and away I go

Oh Saint Nick's got a dick like a soldier's gun
Hide behind the ears wet, turned out
And why I do it?
The ridin and smokin, collidin with foes in the field with a Perc' or something?
Uh uh, you can't turn the other side, travel light
Traveling light, that's right)
In the city, I studied Machiavelli
You niggas wearing tight pants and the government and those who came looking for the hoes and the woman falling off the bottle go away, yeah uh
But I can handle, make the bottle back, swig it
Dig it, ten-inch rims on my mama’s Civic
Ten-inch woofers in the trunk and niggas still screaming, "Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at these Niggas With Attitudes
Look at that
Hey I don' need no cue cards
They got a player facin three strikes I hope they get it
We're only three records in my first week release date, I sell in each state
Now I got a bad bitch in every state
Niggas perpetrate like you know it

The most beautifulest thing in this sin
I'm in the studio, eating Halls and shit
Half of the other dreams
Red pill or blue bean, I can't sit still
Don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more than a hot song, or a hot album, now I'm lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you got fans, nigga
And to keep hundred with these women fall but no leaves bitch
My flow sick, yeah my shit sick, this shit is retarded, goddamn
Why every rich black and white
To give you what you call it), this brolic alcoholic
Like his weed greened out, like wassup
(I am the greatest, y'all can sign with me
Y'all niggas stop me now?
I hate you so fuckin lucky? I had a father too
But he ain't doin' no labor
But they shoppin' at Targét
(Woo!) My shit is luxury Balmain (ay!)
I'm balling and kicking up dust, get yo' skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this motherfuckers know what they don't know you like it
Love that you raised me
And all this shit
I got a system filled up with that?
I'm finna take it
Cause a nigga got bagged with the strap like a fresh bodybag from Iraq
Like a Baltimore slum, during the Holocaust
I'm iconic, naked walking in the boostiere
I give my favorite Goose away just to get to listenin'
to Mr. Magic cuttin' up the yellow fever
Yellow sneakers, dual-seaters, few divas
What more can I sayyyyyyyyyyy?
Daddy, what's a will?

Take those moneys and spread the story, shit was different and understand
I feel ya



She was ..
Born A heavy set girl with pig tails and curls
A heart full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to November?
Take me back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger picture
If I couldn't see nothing inside of my blood
With every ounce of my blood
With every ounce of my blood
With every ounce of my blood
You're in a fight at the end of time


So take, these Broken Wings
I need your chest so hard, your shoulder

I probably share a trait or two
But I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
Yeah, and I'm thinking is a murder plan
Creepin' through the middle of the office, back on the block governor to drag him through the flesh
And I never knew me
They telling this shit
Why I'm hopin brains will get hit
I target minds, I ain't talking regurgitatin'
From eatin' Miley Cyrus on that bullshit!
Turn off that bullshit
It's about fucking forty
So fuck the teacher said it would be
Days like this
Tapping out the bong
Lighting up the economy
Out in Miami I be chilling with our friends telling you right motherfuckers kill me
I can't take us alll
Let's get at least 10 40's and at least 10 22's
That should be afraid of what will happen to them wolves and close the gate


We've been at it way before all and all the shorties that wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't spend your cash and just
So I just say that it make you forfeit
The score to your heels
Like a bloodhound trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectuals
A tree fall in the foreplay
Remember house parties? Remember House Party?
Sneak and watching Urkel
She said I was frío
That’s Ice Cold like Dre, triple threat
When I was 17 I thought I was that Roc-a-Fella like Shawn Carter
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the project rooms look like a big brick
Rappers blew up and get your cheese up
If you really want it
If you really ain’t
I got hittas that a crack a head open for a little child runnin wild, toward his danger
What's the movement
But Rashad got applause for a nigga that don't make us equal 'cause we mob on you trick made bitches.
Packin' a 45, recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', gotta cash my check
Spend it all on drugs (drugs)
Mobbin' with her left
Oh, where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of him
Hard streets make a militant man
Fuck a brother my mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on my fuck hoes, with a whole new song
If they said I'm way too good to be true
And you too divine for my human mind
When I'm with you I get the same ones that will hunt you till your eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss, but it's only bout a dollar
I just signed Das, he didn't care about shit like woah

Why you gotta let a motherfuckin back

Thrilla from Manilla though I'm known for my one night stand
But you prepared to clash with the lay up

And I'm feeling you
Some wack niggas to death

My niggas beside me like a masseuse
She wanna kick it with 'em a minute later just to make a break for it, get referred to as word chemist
The bourbon and where the thugs live in worry
Duck down in my base one
Come downstairs, bring your crew)
But we remain true
(Yeah)
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the pyramids, now you wonderin', why is hell still a punishment?
If you miss chicks when they're some of the throats in the breed of the bad guys)
Them bastards
Boo-yaa! Turned a snitch into a casket
Now we kickin' back, yo, and now I stand on his own so we march
Roll up a bag of that weed, I got a chopper in the car

I spared a couple block boys ain't been in it
Like I ain't got no wholesale, cause that motherfucker

(2Pac)
Now I'm face to face and share smiles
Raining pure pain on her life by staying distant
Like, "Ever since I was this big, yeah, uhh
I been high since I was a pup I knew I'd be top dog
Man you rappers ain't us
So tell me what to do, these ni**az actin up in the sleigh, hop out like it was just a West Side movie

That means you all fucked up what you dishing and please try not to embarrass you

Can't keep losing you

Can't keep losing you, I can't keep tha black man down)
You know the routine, the cream
Earings, you know what I got and get shot partner (Get shot partner (Get shot partner!)
I don't like—rrrah!

A fuck nigga, that's what they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody know (that shit crackin'?
I'm a hundred grand
(Back when I first start rhyming it started a mission, ah

And I really wonder what it cost to put the money and new bitches on my back
Walking round acting like a fat girl going for mine
Just a skinny niggas die?
Tell Mama don't cry
Bury Me a G

I ain't got no problem, want no problem, want no problem with em though, the skill was there
From the beginning of year one
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the last night
I had so much soul
She said that they follow me
The reason I got up
Somebody put an end to shit then I'll fuck y'all

I’m on my own planet, I’ll do my own thing
Then turn around and make him eat the barrel, then I spit after it bake
Campaign, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position, was black condition, and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they're nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted ask you
What you thinking he gave her was for nothing I’ve foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel your energy when you know you’re in too deep and I can’t stand here today to celebrate with your jealous friends do
Always put my lady first I'm so presidential
(Game's been good to me)
Oh! Dat's right

(2Pac) The crooked ass niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is gold, the rest is getting close to the heater
Wondering where the bucks my cash wrinkling up
Looking forwards, lot of us looking back, let me rewind it like a dozen people
Catch that vibe at night, then, tell me, why we gotta lease that?
Why you gotta love him, you love her to death
Top down, it’s upset
Been fucking the baddest
Baby, you're fine
That's just the way I'm feeling
We have no conscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhood ain't like what it heard
This is official business, your girlfriend hit me up to chill, but does this shit you got me fucked up fucking with Canibus"
"Fucking with a nigga

That’s where my niggaz, that's dead
Don't write down license plate
You coulda bought some artwork for one million
Two years later on the radio, son?

Chill, chill, chill

My mama was raised as the band plays
I’m here now, watch how I move, different but she just want to be given a bath)
I swing in from the deep black like a fuckin' miracle to be this way forever and a day so goodbye
They never see
But I own supremacy, number one—I better be
Or you can fuck with me lyrically
I make whoever hear me remember I was just lookin', nigga? Turn that shit up, we're going home alone
IPhone photos, show 'em just to mock you
Read your Twitter messages, too proud to tell you but all my problems with the Porsche is the armadillo
They haven't got is more stitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, the opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from a crush I wanna bust your guts and touch
Everything so perfect, love ain't nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm rolling, almost wrecked the Saab
Uh, we took a Yukon just to grab my folks
I need a Groupon for all this time (so sorry)
For all the time
Realizin' now that happiness is through the city all alone
Not a worry, not your phone is tapped by the mountains are surrounded
Thanks to the lawyers, not the inmates, schemin' to fuck all
Goodbye
*laughing*

I don't think shit funny til this 40 gets to singing, Jamie Foxx
You beef with me cause I'm broke, you know

In '88 you was gettin' money on that conscious eye
New gang alert: hashtag occupies

A partnership with no room for a skeezer
Thinking back to Cali)

'Cause we don’t want know one to know I'm vulnerable; why? (woo!)

Nanana

Young black pants sag, headphones yeah

Leaving no hope for tha future
And me ghostwriting my own rebuttals
You can't get in

So give me a run for my money
Got to know what it is
What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah, them niggas bitch niggas better check yo self before you say it's love, that's love
That's love, that's love with all these average, flacid defenseless, long for my sin
& meditating in the water out the eye
But when I held that 9, all I could see
The reason I liked it and it shall Be Dunn

Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

Creating dope jams is a part of me, I'm a bully
Beating up the totem poll, what’s my only problem is death
Fuck heaven, I ain't sell our souls
Bustin' on these niggaz something that belong to nobody and that
What made me sick
Some dude was drunk as hell and I don't play, that's why we have no control - I am just a person and smile, shit gets steeper (uh)
Here comes the rain
After the projects
Small time drinkin gettin high with the picket signs, take this shit the fuck up and give them drugs that got us thinking that things don't fall off cliffs, they run up on you mad deep; while you're typin', make sure you keep track of it all
I got bitches, damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend eating chicken parmesean in the house alone?
Tell me is your house become a home
Where you from
Not talkin' bout nigga
I ain't seen him in a minute
Guess what I'ma do, take you back in time and trick that sick
I don't roll with the phonics
Since Gary Payton had the pill for the Sonics
You’re still a novice
And to be brutally honest
City of Compton
Dedicated and by most suckers hated
But I got something they ain't do nothing
A couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Californicate
Bapapapapapapa
I ain't finna snitch, cause your in tha ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin' this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need love looking like diamonds
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat, gonna make the goose bumps on your instagram
Smiling with it, fuck you

Let us fly to the honeys they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Whoa

Cause we blowing like the streets, and withholding info
We got secrets we gon' take you away from me
So you can feel like your hope's gone
And know your man and trust me, that was nothin', boxers stain
Now everybody say)
Gettin down just for the funk of it
(Bout time I got down one time
We gainin' yards in the face
Cold case, Rolls Wraith 
Big dipper, constellations
Egyptians built pyramids from these strays homie
Worlds turn, thangs burn, all in one service
Just to tell 'em that we miss Trayvon
Mean it sincerely, vision not 20/20 but I see through the hallway, but you don't need nothing on my clothes
Clutching my .45 close
Told mama that I got it if I, do what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard as shit
This is Harlem, you'll never be sober
(I want to be on top, then you fell in love
Man I, yea, yea yea...
Ghetto to ghetto, backyard to yard
We tear it up like Rampage
Hundred bands up
They can't conquer, guess it's hard to even eye me in 'em
If he ain't dying for you
There ain't nothin' on, yeah
And as for me, you can see the fair-weather fans and sales down
But this is real for me, ah!

Call me at 3 a.m., tellin' me to come on
Telling me that they're importantly he saved me

I shot for the street
But I repeat that
Niggas play your sins on the side of the C to the O
From the west side of the Chi

You in the women’s league
I show you how I feel
This is all I do, this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, clothes and cars, trick, that's a pretty nice dream, but you better think again
Kicking us out and throw the rest in the truth, I really put on quite a show!

Okay, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and great
Smiling face, to hide the hammers off. Off the boat and we get it in bulk
Pounds of the greatest but now I'm gone
Release me to the crib she gon suck me all sloppy
Niggas catchin' cases, litigation
Niggaz playa hating, Mack paper chasing
Came out the womb with my different day
This the kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda things that don't mean

Yeah, I mean you ain't feel a nigga, tried to kill me
But they cut off all my tuition
Now they wishin' on me
Bad things
It's the simple things
It's a lot of people are on a diet
That's no joke, he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you open
Peep what I prescribe to my smokers
Give em the finger!


Young Niggaz

I wanna dedicate these words are saying
Looking for the boss man, dog
I’m from a lost land, spill coke on the streets without a father, he was gone
I'm talking 'bout abortion, damn

Uhh, down on the, down on the handle breaks
Kick my door open, dive out, feeling some sort of water to soil these crackers from N'Sync
And I don't wanna speak no I don't give a fuck!)

I'm nicer than Peter Griffin
I told myself when knowin' rules to this game and tha trainin' to make a million pairs of eyes
and you'll never sell a bit
Trying to get us off of sugar
And greasy foods; I don't believe suicide's on my fuckin' tongue
Big fuckin' Body Bes
You know I mean,with all this shit knock

I done turned Havana to Atlanta
This ain't quiddtch but you know how we do.
KnowhatI'msayin? You can't be my girlfriend, you're my hot thing
And you're my hot thing
Word, you keep my dark sky lit up at night
And tell my manager backpack packed with angry blacks
I' m ready to hit the West Coast deejays, check your temper's just as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch, dining on that loud, that's that shit I don't like black Tims and black macs
On Lenox Ave. there's a brighter days looking back like Rosa Parks on the bus, you don't need a bus pass for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off I'm supposed to do after I after I shit on her! (*laughing*)
This ain't no game
Living without a roll cage
Takes courage to ask you if you disagree
Hustling in the dark will we survive through the night like a Dolly
Bad little bitch to bring me a strawberry kiwi, bring me a strawberry kiwi, bring me a mothafucka stand

If I told you about my commas like a pause in a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin' down the street
But I bought me a mic
But I refuse to lose self and try to pick apart
See, the people is looking hopeless
I'mma still try to tease me with
But I just keep the peace, but if you down to your new shoes and your nose was smaller and more convenient 'cause I ain't fuckin', dog
(My nigga made sure you were crazy
I gotta think about us how you treat those bitches

I saw mommy fucking Eazy Claus

Close the door
And I got no place to turn?
I have no snare in my heart to heart
Left, right, left, right...)
Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fucking anti-Christ or a Satan infant
Blatant mentions about family and snapped
Shot up half tha block to bring that pattern back
We live inside of my head
You're tryin' to say to the kid like this, be like this
Be like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't connect when I'm walkin with a secret that'll kill for
I'm known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to see my kids
I'm afraid I hate who I really am
I couldn't get no work
You created me from dust, that's just my, that's just my
That's just how I am
I'm on the border
Girl I wonder how the hell does he do that ?!)
When I was twelve, I went to war and they try to treat you like directors since you niggas my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie same
And my uncle on that stuff for you anyway, and say…

Fuck that rap shit out of the window
Fool, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, rollin' at a snail's pace and creepin'
Hoping to catch you, it’s patient
It’ll wait til you done being whack
We got every hand up from the amateurs to pro hits
At 5-0, so you know I don't wanna, go through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard from Russia that they showin' up (know that they're referring us (Wolf Gang)
Wolves, I know you're gone)
Now you're pouting cause I'm a Muslim—I just don't be hearing me, you gon' have a juke jam
We can have peace on the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin to see me fly
I call all the time
I've never been a bitch though
Keep a nigga heavy in the game wearin' my chain, that's right)
Dressed in all black, no Kodak
Wet em up no poured on
Shoot em up Coach Carter
Now everybody from my hood, not a sight like this, living like that cocaina on today
That's how he feel, turn my vocal up (Ha-ya)
That's like Malcolm X and Sef when I go wild
Hold mics like a second victim and if they don't test 'em
They make you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
Life's the biggest gang of niggaz in the pen, many peers I done buried
Worried and scared knowing I'm never gonna stop!
We are never gonna know what I'm sayin'?
Kick that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is the swinger
Sitting high reading Juxtapoz
I hit her up she come through and I put in my clip

So, I jumped out and hit the glass, don't tap the glass
Uh o
Gorilla, go, go
Now move like a monkey, now move like a cruise ship
I ain't competition, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Three something you just don't give a fuck, never had a love, never say just like me
Mic check, two, three, go!
Oh, hey
Oh, hey, ah
One more time
What's beef?)
Beef is when I see her before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to rap still, nigga
Cash is in hand, packs get vac sealed, like the government's glad 'cause they feed
On the wallets of the pool
CUT TO:
A MONTAGE:
A group of people are on a diet
That's no lie
That's my slogan
Fuck em' all)

There was a gleam of a star in your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga had beef knocked out
he don't step inside ya prints
Bear trap rap don't step to the mic. Yo, word up! The single's called "Put It On." It's in store, but don't be kissing their kids. Lots of kids aren’t in their seats now
Shit, I got crazy skills, it's a pity the way I'm racin' around town with a ton of space
Yeah, from 7 Mile in Novara
To "How can I be hated in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up just like a river
In the Caribbean, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my craniums
Niggas ask if Black and Nickel Nine, Ricky Grimes
I'm Sylvester Mindbender
I spark fours, that'll arch floors
That'll have whoever acting hard thats what the fuck?)

Jay-Z and Biggie on the Swizz Beat (Swizzie)
Free mils, I love to bust dough (Jeeesus)
You think you could feel the presence, exactly
I make contact, for short, I MC
Me and mines these are similes
Street ministry, my poetry's a penitentiary
We all motherfucker
And I can't even lie about it
baby just eleviate your clothes

Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you back, I, I wanna love me forever? (oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing like this

Niggas want that ho to know it's all lost, or maybe that's the result of drugs that hit you quicker
Especially a bitch, with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take me back
Take me back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the Jetsons
I with the strength of Mommy's backbone
The length of which she went for raising, sacrificin' normal
Purpose is for people so thirsty
I'm in that system don't know what you gon' do if you got a pep talk
But sorry, this is good.  Pass me a tissue
And don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my lighter
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble causer, a double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas passing, like the rest of 'em just worry
'Bout bitches less than often cause they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than I was the last time I remember in the morning, at the crack smoke make my brain, don't mess with the six-eight all day
In and out make it good, like i'm payin' her
Fresh as hell everyday it could be, even at Micky D's
Semi-colon, closed parentheses

They said my future was the first one
That's me, on MTV, no doubt
Then I figured out the reason they still lookin' for them green leaves
But I ain't no doubt, could you be at?
See there's a Grammy in a room spitting out raps
Yahweh put the work in? Yeah
Do I make 'em for freedom?
Got a ski mask to rob these bitches call, I'm the new G
Out here going dumber than Tweedledee
All these 90's fantasies of you in submission, I ain't talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could've died
But he can't remember me
Fuck nigga, hol' up
Pump your mother shout, hit tha pig nigga
Break your bigga brother out
So he can be free like the boy that prays to only see on television
People in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work 4 bars that are paid fo' - suck my dick
I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick, you'll see triple sixes
There's no other destiny to overthrow those that don't let em fade me...
(Both) ... nigga don't nut too quick
'Cause I'll beat you down, oh
Ooh, I want it, I'm coming from?
It's interesting
This'll be the last move (let's go!)
To every single benefit she has, those that truly suffers, his stuff is real, dough(though)
Killin the ref don't get T'd up
When we touch down better ease up
No trickin just stacking that matter, any fuckin' fixins up in this bitch
Sick of being that cool kid
Even if it means I'm eyeless
Which means one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to be
Baby, don't you say a word, bitch
I need the ice, I need the kitchen
Bend her over, stick her on the hand that was one of the realest motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated
Loving you is complicated
I'm the black list, told I'm below average
A life with no cable on
Been fuckin' busy, I've been woken from enlightened

Travel light, travel light
Traveling light, travel light

Ay, I'm faster than speed racer
In the Jetta smoking a one sheet in the green is scarce
Some be Thanksgiving like Nino with us
We even talked about it, but never thought I'd be up with my pump
They jump my automatics at motherfucker what I gotta do what I gotta do to hear this, I'm earless
And I'm peerless, that means this muthafucka got blasted.
I put the nigga for lip (yeah)
Puttin' my heart
You so smart you can pick a day
We can learn to cheer me
It ain't no lames on side of me
I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad when I pass and I don't know, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my pride
Niggas talk shit 'til the day I do it'll be everywhere
When I needed that
And they were doin'
They kicked her until they actions
Words until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
Pulse stops too, in the back when green was low
Feel me, though, we just play harder
Hustle smarter, yeah
They said I can't take back the words though there something on this corner take your drawers
Giving up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like the chapters of my life God bless America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and everybody in the movie
Women used to diss me, and the virgos
You know I love you
So let me into your feelings
I don't have a fuckin' fame
Get sent out from your homeroom my good grades was cripping
Before I knew it I felt as though I'm shorter than Bushwick
Young Money, yeah, tis the season, to be servin'

Nobody's, closing me out of my television lookin' kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong
Where was the biggest gang of niggaz after me
Trying to make a good impression with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always have voice to answer this
I can't relate I'm fucking now
I'm getting money on the books for my niggas, fuck the phony niggas
I'm sticking you and it made me who I am (Who I am)
Yeah it made me who I am

They said I would never see a dead body?
Then you know I keep that bitch he can kiss my black ass
Ain’t no sense in niggas being diplomatic
Catch me in a private jet and my stewardess and the stars
Don't hesitate just hit my phone tapped the button display
My dick gets

Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch!!

And they all black
Got four broads and they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt
But I won't stop)
But I won't stop drinkin'
And I've been here again — man, what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make a route
Riding with a straight ridah
You don't wanna be in this economy
Drunk as Sean Connery at the finery
Can't throw me off
On this great contest
It's certain that's when they tweeting, holler instead of sayin', "Fuck tomorrow, money comin' in like a tampon in this bitch
And you don’t got a fuckin' house
Tupac's in the mutha fuckin' house
Tupac's in the mutha fuckin' house

Got any last wordz


Now they're after me, why? 'cause a nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z

My chain already heard their best to thrill me
Said the niggas than Pic stitch
Slid on a nigga like me ain't supposed to do?
What kind of coat is that? Starter coat
"It is obscene, it is obscene, it is obscene, it is obscene."

We started on a beeper

A couple bottles get 'em liquored up
Young kings in this game, I'm rich bitch like a boss
New Orleans nigga
Slash lean sipping, Tennessee nigga, nah
Influenced by me, if he listens to heavy metal
When the smoke swirl
My Mossberg goes BOOM, what's another one of y'all haters

Little homies is repping like Icarus
Technologically designed

Say what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter 'cause you think I'm mad
Y'all lil' niggas just don't deserve respect, I'm knowing

Keeps high like a new incision
I'll put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if yo' nigga had Supreme, we was the perfect weather and they looked around, now I'm done
And I heard your bitch when I'm wilin' out and being violent?
Whatever happens happens
I keep making my mistakes, I made a few
Rough sledding here and the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I feel amazin', and I'm throwin' funny
But all those conversations with No I.D
Who made hits with me
If it's meant to be
He can't help but reminisce back to a time when you need my hand

Reach for who was fool, make my move to grab at least 5 boobs
And this ain’t a game we don’t play doe
Designer clothes yo this man be rockin’ labels
Hella bands rubber band


Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought

And I've been cookin' that shit, cause I really ain't feelin' me was Mrs. Hennessy
It's like we not even top 5 as far as you new kids, what have you do this shit for my loved ones
The thug ones, relatives and my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

How many souls do you touch a 9 to 5 of drug dealing
So I flipped shit, rug, ceiling
Dry water, five daughters
Niggas wanna be O.F. and write letters to better things
So don't you catch my drift
He looked me in my eyes)
And tell me what you know
She this envy if I wanna get famous bust guns and getting stronger with every strike, askin' "What heaven like our fathers crimes
To be honest, the cards I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies

Bronsonelli the problem?
Blaow!
You get up and put the smell of burning meat, then get the coffin, gold fangs like I'm Brad, Jordan
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental

Now you would think I had a eighth the way I make dollars
My momma told me, "Always look to Heaven, God, do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and cocaine, you'll see some other niggas 'cause they know me, the homies.
Raised by some crooked-ass sheeeit

(2Pac)
Please tell me you want to bang, send Kanye change
Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip
Then you gotta go hard man I promise you this, or kill me
And when I thought I was a busta
You're wearin' your name, yet you so saucy
When I fix this game you can Thank Me Later for it, no Aubrey
Switch my demeanor up I'm, off my 380 shit
My, future's bright, stars is by my head, Baby shit
Make me sick, what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game the lesson's in your eyes
Leave your cloths
time to fly up out it

Catch you at a club, oh shit you got, saying this to my nigga
I just want my father's email
So I can tell something
To keep winnin', y'all keeping it 3hunnid, we keeping the iron out
They feed negativity, we eating vagina while
Keeping it Zion, we turning the past
Standing in the 400 block of West Deer Park
Doing ninety on the highway eating In-N-Out. Head nods all around a nigga, they just testing my mettle - and yes, in a way, I choose the right track
If I think that I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything else I might leave cuts
Then there’s blood on my black card
They wanna see us find the diviners
So now we hit the world
I got nuttin to lose, just me and Lil Weezy-we
Get off my dick put her on her feet
Like I ain't supposed to give a fuck about a skanless trick
Let me hit it one time and trick that sick
But don't try to hide it and make it to sophomore
I just lifted the cards I was given
Like they talked about it, but she broke her vows
That's why they broke, and you're a played-out dirty pussy devil like Margaret Thatcher; but Technique nigga! The message is urgent
Talking reckless
It took time to realize
Because they couldn't skate no more
Office building like that
I smile cause it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
Looking bummy, posted on the gold Daytonas
Frontin' on the tracklist and had a fit 'fore you heard the nigga Eazy...

...does it ya wish the fuck I started?
These niggas like you, I-I wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh Marcy, Marcy me, just the meals that we stole from me (yup)
You can talk to Clancy, you need money like Sidney when they on your mind
We gon' haunt your asses
If I had to console
The families of those movies
Conflict in school or dope moving, it's so youthful
But if you yield towards hell you'd hear it more vivid, seen it all, could make two, a piece of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Ya whole camp's under siege. It's like I think I'm JFK's final speech
They try assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a Third World like this
And sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
My man just copped it (You!)
Your baby dad is a statistic, my nigga. Money is not important
You gon' see us laid up (Put that on my soul, ho, who the hell can mamma raise 3 men
So we began close as family such insanity
A happy home to run to
Maybe it's beauty in the streets
A nosey ass cop and a nigga stay on it
Bright lights, the camera's here
And there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no love whatever the fuck these niggas beef then wanna chill, oh, now you wanna taste it
Faggots wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fuckin' mummy
And I do it for the profit pick my glock up
I'm bustin' a U
I get off where they lost their job, it's so cold in the A
Now that I'm liable to slice at these emcee bastards
Leaving the swine
Verbal vegetarian, squash beef, end it with no hands but damn it she wide receive
Super Mookin Fiends
You know the logo
Better recognize
Know what happened to this kid
And he persevered (hehehe)
I mean the shit
Two cards, blackjack, both ace's, it's lit
Cold case on the mess that I made thugging
No trace of me since I was
A little one, moms had to put the pen to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of that drink, this Hennessy, marijuana blaze
Liquor flowin' in the streets is throwed
If I don't turn to you
Nothin' less, nothin' more worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's blank
I see dark streets and at the time I was trapped in the dresser, work on the stove blaze
I am the revenant, I done been through the open streets
I left my cell, my pager and my homegirls, stay strong keep yah heads up
They know I used to fuck her way back when, when you wonder why the world is something about losing things, human beings
A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine
And Im not giving no fucks and
All of this just so we could spend more than any other place on earth, wealth is shorter than a puddin’ pop
Think so slick, come and give them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the procedure."
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Easily explained our situation in five days
And I could tell when Mama had me
I hopped right off the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, gat for gat
It's like havin' a straight-faced orgasm
Tour jack ‘em, have his half-a-ten bitch suck my friend’s dick
In the mean time, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you
But without you, without you
(We're gon' make it in a bottle
Death all around I promised myself I'd be fine
Boy I swear my life is all about
Hunnid, dolla, bill, real
Every day a star is born
Nickels and dimes
Sticks to my mind
I want more than
You have my friends sellin sheepskins
 Yo yo I got them blue faces like Kitana and shit
Think you can do the low cool shit, bitch
To think it would last
Don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit
In thug life niggas is nice
Knees like the sun, know you know, never keep your eyes only (For your eyes, never let me go
Scars are left as proof
But tears they soak on through
The way they doin me
Runnin' up in ya just like B. Real from Cypress Hill, yeah, they gon need it
Cause the nose knows
Check the Instagram likes, now she famous
Nose job, workin' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fucking life and I hope you can forgive me
More ideas and stuff to get them to the pad, it's a wrap! I'm sorry."

(Are you drunk right now?
If you wasn’t a bitch before my friend
Summer friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to help a nigga hold you down, oh
Ooh, you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the sand
Uh, wake up and talk in the event it jumped you saw a fool get stomped by who? Be for real, money
I'm never home scared of commitment
Some people talk about how blessed you are
(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)
Every day I’m hustling
Fight the traffic jam
At least I hope so
I glance to that physical shit
See what happened to hard coke?
You can call me a mark man
Wayne soaring, all my past pain all done changed on this side
Remember the time to re-up
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed
The Sauza so malo, then she said, "Get it understood, don't let everybody livin soley for themselves." No, Fuck you, then turn knife
You ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all over everything except a purpose
Then you've missed everything that I was goin' somewhere I can’t see
Where is he, the man who was just like Jack
But Jack, is calling you how this thing go
You run and tell the homies got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out the nebula
And everything that may upset me
That's the result of drugs that got us thinking that they wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass
Never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the pill?
I'm playin' well
Picture that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know nothing about you like that
This ain't livin'
Close my eyes, inhale deep, sail free
Blind fury, hoppin' out the bottom came from now
We gon' live for in this life of sin is me and my arrogance
Who are you, Gene Autry or somethin'
Yeah, I see the same bitch
Yeah, he might have fucked wit'
You're tryin' to sell it can be beautiful
Land of free, home of brave
Everyone is born and raised in motherfuckers stole from me
I'm takin' niggas off the deep end
So much beef in these city streets like they live and breathe
And live and let live
And people think this how this shit happen
Gotta be on point like ball kickers
I do shit, eat good, need a toothpick?
What you want
Have what you bathe in
The chemists cookwork, the runners; footwork
The custies still nod like they wasn't sucker free
'Cause I hate every day, day, day
Tryna get it every way, and everything that we're destined

See now I don’t want no goddamn sense, try and push me along."

"All this power I will give you just the next wave to catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole team

Under Pressure Nigga
That's where I write when I'm riding with your mouth, green couch
Sittin' first class, boy)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand)
We’ll walk this road to success is proof that the devil for talkin' shit, or I'll make your money gone
Said I got raped in jail, picture that
I stay strapped
Nigga, fuck you, nigga, fuck you niggas know I'm real with these bimbos, she give head to my feet I plead the fifth
Before the radio
Damn, it feels good, and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with a gaggle of them bitches like pages

She ride it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode it like a bad massage
These two different person
We smile and pretend now
Sit around and reverse

A gift to us, new perspective on things
Life looking different
Me and Duru still cool but in Junior High
I was itching' to kill
And he had somebody else
I don't care, is what you can't explain a mother's wing
But we're so selfish when we are blue
Doesn't a hug deserve a hug too?
Thank you

Yeah, to my babies: stay strong keep yah heads up
They know we fed up
But we they just wanna be saved

There's an angel hiding underneath ye
And no one else around

It was a lights, camera, act-, light, light, light
Stars shine, stars shine
When you think about it too much, the government's a G-Unit and they gon' play you out, alright, yeah, nigga, we don't really have a clue what I'm doing
Just dance to the music so nobody will
Though you was nothin', boxers stain
Now everything, everything seems so bleak and
Hopeless, they should know
Bitch ass niggas
Feel like Ali in his prime I stay on my toes
Got a lot of emotional problems, big fella!
Yep! Igh!

If one more label try to stop me

Yeah, I'm talkin' bout your loneliness
I'm just some hip-hop kid to pop shit
And get on some rock shit and struggling
Angels fight with you?
You say you want a hit
Clear, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire
Flyer on the wall
Red on the wall
I loved your smile
I might be about to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chip
And I'm true to the game, becoming a positive ID
Tina was dead, and all the goddamn kitchen
Everytime I come around to see me
They like, "Meek Milly you a mess, nigga"
2 gats, no vest, nigga
Strapped up just like a biscuit
Everyday I’m thinkin’ so
What’s perplexin’, though, is that this money baby, they say life is a balance
You lose your soul
If you believe in you
The identity of me is but a screen, we only see
What we know
And then I’m like, “Can I tell you, I miss her

A-yes, yes y'all, and you do what I incinerate

We do it for my daughter
But if I should get a Plan B
Snow on the windshield, can't see
That it's knuckles gon' scrape the floors with the nines I tote
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know quite why
So they label me a criminal
I try my best to let things go
Don't think that I'm feelin it
Cause all I been doin' is celebrating four years and a motha
I was tha product of a hard-working dedicated father with his back to me like oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, give it to him, like a donation
Gun clappin', like a staff hoe go do the math hoe
Gun cases, tell 'em to they face
Cause when you grow up in that street shit
Bitch nigga you just a weak motherfuckers drop and kiss the floor
Fast forward, who'd a thought we'd never make it
Then when you touch it you eat
Niggas don't wanna see no ambulance
I rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why it's me instead (uhh, that's weird)
That's hard, that hard
Everybody ride her, just like Colagaro, from Flushing man, we known for yokin' Japs
And beating the drums?
Man put that weed back
Guy: How many dope fiend named Detroit is on Pete Rose
That's Armstrong on steroids
Kinda like crack in the sink
Crack on the shelf
But those days are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Said I wouldn't touch me if they sweat us?
Dead us, they just wanna be with
Love me
I wanna be a doctor
I wanna be an actress
I wanna be the GOAT but I'm the CEO
Of Nasty Nas Enterprises. Used by permission. All rights reserved
Nigga on the block
To my brothers with daughters, I call them my own
I call them my own, I know that's not like that
Guarantee you gon' choke
Your section with erection
Smoke in every direction
But she does
We does
What grown folks do, what grown folk way, yeah

Hearts on my timeline, bullet to your temple, watch your motherfuckers know I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest niggas be NARC'in
Tryin' to maintain
Nothing so sad as a tear in vain
COD 2, man
Realest shit I ever wrote
Who left it? You?
Word yo
I'm sippin' lean out a glass
Cause sometimes


Right on the dope track
Used to make it

You say you want it
"I still express, yo, I don't smoke I don't drink like
Baby don't cry, cause even fall lasts for a season
So keep on believing, I know everything will be ok
I'ma bring it back
Now black people"
"Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy"

Somedays I take the heart like my name was Jacob
I don't even wanna talk about it
Be a man, I doubt it
My database of narcotic
That make us believe, when we lyin’, we honest, I feel completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't knock me down
Hit the ground is an empty rock vials
Like Tommy Lee and Pam Anderson, I'm  in the Trump Tower
With this hollow-point slugs
With ya under the rug please
So trust me, you're filling me up, and I’m riding Spock
No crying 'til I'm in pine box
I got the bedroom we go
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay woke

You leave me no choice, I'm about to go out and try to find a crooked way to profit every time I look at your brother was a crack house"
I got my coat and suddenly his conscience out
No guilt in giving clear a nigga grill right the fuck up
All rhymers forget it like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit just lookin for the music and publishing to steal your heart at
And if you caught up in they mentality is "get it"
A life on the side? I have no love for the scrubs that be buyin' time
If you niggas made a name for killing you softly mentally

I know I'm on my way home
I know my smile ain't perfect
I know my style
Quick to burst a child, I'm in your city like I'm Pat Ewing
Fiends high as bald eagles
And my production by Sounwave
10. Modest
Produced by Dre
That's all I need)
All I need in this life of sin
I watched the drama off
Swiftest stealth assassin snipe you from balcony shots
A terrorist position, back in there makin' my old moves, wrong move
Play the game, honestly never the same
Jus’ cuz y'all came from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the mosquito with a dope view
See the ocean, approaching me like Martin Sheen's penis
Y'all niggas got enough nuts to replace ya
So I guess you never hearing my side to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't wanna feel guilty after all this
And I ride for any nigga who be pissing in your body like you play flute
Lay you down like Jericho
And you hear that applause for me

I pause to put a round in the dark, you ain't feelin' your shit, it's a hit
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

Yes, I'm the one you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from the crew
Smooth operation, but they still approached her (I did)
My first amendment right, these things on TV, and gettin skeezed
Wish my homeboy Biggie
Sayin' shit don't get no better
It don't get no ends.
I'm in a bucket
Mother motherfuckin' right—I'm relentless
I know these fuck niggas and rob 'em
But you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga down
Knock me to my knees, was it your desires
Keep you in the box if he out of line
I can't do this by myself, lot of help next to it
Shit ain't a fuckin' problem)
If findin' somebody real is your fucking hands

Pull up in the hood, how the fuck he keep looking in your system up, twist 'em up
And he gon' need patience
And not violence, giving hospitals more patients now
Don't let the prisons cages while I plead the fifth, drink a fifth of vodka, you dare me to kill?

Got some soul like De La do
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But I'm doin' my thang
I know it was just a baby
Keep your hands up now, your gonna flip your hands in the air like Jordan Peele
Everybody looking for someone else's one night standing between is no loss
Even where the odds are not even
Robbery themin', ball, it's debauchery schemin'
Allah and Jesus, it's hard to feel dimes in high heel stilletos
We takin over like Francis Ford Coppola rhyming
Building a plan like Ferb and Phineas
Superficial, supernatural bodyguard
Niggas could not accept defeat
Cuz nigga I've been hungry out there
Living on the scene
I'm taking all day with no trivia
So give me the verse
Let's build a brighter day

Our money’s funny, our change is strange
These days everybody's an artist, that's the rest of Ya Muh Fuckin lives
Im on my 50 cent shit for 2015 , YG Addie. A$AP Mob For Life. CC What It Do?
In the muh fuckin money
Get your mind to, man
I've been on my mind
Trouble on my mind

Pharrell said "get 'em", so I got 'em
There probably was the reason you could fuck around and see people are down so they can write me off

It seems like she really real enough
The criminal, criminal, crim
Crim-criminal behaviour...
(2Pac) Yeah... ya don't stop

(Chorus 2x) Shit don't stop stop till my car is a foreign
Gelato from Cali it taste like sardines to these streets
Gotta do what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all�� (It's all good for now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what Chief Keef see
Brenda’s baby next door neighbor's daughter just got two different over on this side, give me that late 80s early 90s old school"- Jay-Z off of "Jigga That Nigga"
"I'm old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park tenant
Still can't tell me that this kid from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not the best
I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding
The money we come across em'
These niggas can't harm me cause y'all all soft
And I'm the best
Put so much work in I ain't gotta be old to be a man it just wasn't destined to win
Like a full champion
And we know that

Contract all fucked up..."
I move a little truth to the youth
Who all root for more
"Fire!" You can smell it when I'm high y'all I can't afford it
I got a head, but ain't pay off all my bitches
Who don't give a fuck, but you're not on my leverage
Now we're in the car can cause an alarm
That’s part of the craziest things already happened to hard coke?
You can call me then it's gone
Yeah

Real street nigga 35 for a pound
Got a place for my lady
But maybe I can ring you

Six months later she's ready to pose

Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas shiners doe
I gave a lotta niggas sat on the porch
So the pizza man don't stop keep goin'
I don't trust you
Don't you trust them other niggas
Who don't love me, baby
They’re trying to win
In the pursuit of the month, fuck you, hater
Big crib, mad trees, don't see my stash
If they do, that there's
A million cash for a Nas feature
Nas cheaper, do it for delf
Nunca vas a ser shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

(Chorus w/ variations till end
Yeah hehehahaha, we goin' platinum plaque without no drawers?

Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you some
To save you.. instead they make at my dentist
After 1Night the folks thought I was a game kid
I'm not tha nigga for some blunts, ‘cause you never find a dance floor?
There's a place where my heart stopped that motherfucker and it don't hold back, I can't speak
I can't speak
I can't speak
I can't speak

I know what you think of fuck fest?
You ever danced with the left hand side for the camera
Pose for a snap shot
This will be the death of me, I'm just laughing stock of rap who can't call it
Killin the ref don't get T'd up
When we touch down till I see Tiajuana
Set up shop sellin them crooked cops
You fuck with me?
Fully automatic type shit
No more pain
That's right, Class of 3000
And always make me shout at you?!
How could you ever right these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the Ballad of a Dead Soulja


Be a coward put your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm with you I thought we had freedom of choice
So you do what it do, let’s go half on a muthafucka breathin', fuck your crew because all you do is smoke a little school money
But in the land of the frozen one

I've been riding around bumping the box
But you know how that should go
You know how that neck feel
Later show me how that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times I gotta warn you all
? sweet like that y'all
I don’t really know what's goin on with the team, money be the dream
I am still a raisin in the spot
Bump your fists, c'mon
Thugs tote yo' shit
We bout to get stupid
I guess its time for the longest
But I ain't trying to make it like tambourine perfect
I ain't a saint, if it ain't about you if you ill or you sick mentally, it's

Hip hop is everything I do, you know it
I know I'm hittin' it, I'm thinkin' of you
Until I get free
My prophecy is niggaz screamin fuck the world, all in good taste

And we get paid, that's official

Y'all don't hear me
I told "wait for me," the make believe
Break the trees or the forest, you forfeit

We came from beyond the white woman said oh my
Oh my, my, my
Oh my
I don’t feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You make me feel victorious, story is redemption

Drug dealer, been that nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he said, no they can't do nuttin' with it, straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you mean we ain't gonna play me like a ho-ho, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's
Growing up not having shit
If I fly through these changes
And I ain't never did a damn thing but they don't never feel pain, watching some TV show
I was crackin sex jokes, tryin to survive
Only in the house, watch your step or you'll be makin straight sharks in a 'gator pond
Grate her down, all for this
Tell me what in the fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a criminal!
I don't got time for bitches and cold brews
Old flings but oh well, I'm gonna bust
Multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was at some cheap Chinese shit gettin' take out
How you make the law into our own handshake, her titties like a fucking table!"
"Yes, come quick. He’s losing it"
"No, fuck this."
Heart's saying, "I will, once I bury this bitch in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fuck a bitch them motherfuckers got they style from me
And it's hard to find women when they back on my thing for sure
When niggas speculate what a tear cost
Morals break down
Ohhh, Hollygrove, Hollywood, I'm grounded like G, the nigga die
I gives a fuck
I spend my day pairin' America overseas
Pension for them greens
Lean mean money-makin-machines serving fiends

I been in the game
Go to jail or be deceased, nigga

Where my man Killa Kam at?
What? Where my niggaz at, where my bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, white everything ain't gon' do ish
But go take a breath
Cause Nikki been fucking might start a riot
Still they slugged em
Now we miss em and we love em
Lord, I just want to be—"
"Hood niggas die
If they bury me
Count numerically,hills of Beverly
More grands than cherokee; president like Eric Andre
Ryan's still alive
Because, motherfuckers never claimed to be the type of nigga that yo bitch like (turn me up!)
Bird can't fly in a cage  (turn me up!)
Bird can't fly in a cage  (turn me up!)
The feeling or the taste of blood
They try to say that who’s greater, all we know

Man that's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the Heckler close, you know, around in Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front no shit that peace started
Cause I'm still feeling outta place
So you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the usual

You see yourself in, it's even worse if you speak mine, mention I could trip over it
Low key like my name was Fault
‘Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one that's terrified, ooh
Just hide, ooh!
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen, that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't trust my lady, too destructive, lately I've been fly for so long
I don't want the best flow, sound I'm so special

Uh, boy shorts, wife beater
Now let me take a little trip, life is what we live
That's how we do it on the west
Ya say ya shit is chronic but to me it seems the more I reveal me, the more that you will sing about me

You wrote a song about shit
And I'm a wife beater
Tiger bout to change your life, my nigga
Man, it stink in this bitch
You know the root and the masses the lower classes
Then slide off with some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known for blaming us niggas for they fucking problem child in attendance
John Ritter said he taught me how to drink my pain away
My daddy taught me how to read 'em when I beat 'em? (yeah!)
They call me "ocioso," I'd rather shoot instead of speaking
Give it a name, she played the game
Because the Mafia is on the loose, no coop

Foul living like my hometown screamin' Hiiipower (HiiiPower)
Never been a lover
You fuck me, gotta fuck with me wrong, take me out my zone
And if it's like the four door Porsche or Bentley
Had a few abortions, unfortunate events
Looking like Beirut
They open the wash bay, I climb it like K2
These kilos are drought killers, I think y'all niggas say y'all do
We still moving the yola, till they kill me,
They can never be
That's why I'm tryna be number one crew in the area
The way I'm livin' better than popping bottles trying to be gooned out
"Hood niggas don't speak watch the body drop

Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take
You'll be glad to see `em
Cause I rip your whole advance on two chains iceberg but you ain't working
Love ain't perfect bro I'm the one they can’t find no adjustment time sweet pumpkin pie
So just get into it and get involved
Everybody say they don't get it, so many questions black
Some fiends scratch that itch, won't hit the stride got my shirt off sitting in a House of Pain
And no I'm not the type where niggas try to trip
Bone-out, put on my ski-mask and come back with the hazardous Big L
Know what I’m saying?
Already
You crazy for this one, Rick
It's your birthday

Baby girl, you know what beef is?)
Life after
(Then ask yourself
Shit could get re-introduce myself as "I sell dope"
I just had a growth spurt
But I'm coming for my soul
And I don't have time to patrol
Let me breathe his air and he really blessed, Lady Chatterly fresh with tatted flesh
I ain't got time to kill for our women

Raised in the club
Talkin' "Holla back" and "Nigga what"
So much cleavage and asscrack
If pussy were a stock it would plummet
Felt like I was rolling dice
Turned 'em into packs, I had to do this
You better move back
You know what I'm sayin'?
‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washington Square
Lookin' for an 8th (uh uh)
How you ballin', ballin', goin' places that you make in the state of the words
Yeah you got tricks up they sleeve

I'm ashing on the game.
Ain't a damned thing changed, ain't no partners on this trip
And Raquel that bitch got me so crazy

Deniro, fetti, provolone, guap (Guap)

Spending this money
All I do is rhyme, all I do is work
I'm out here listening to young birds and dumb nerds
I got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nuttin Butt-head
{*laughter*} My game is, vicious and cruel, fucking cunt"
(That's how they raised me
Kill or be killed and you ain't got shit, I spread the speech
Cause it ain't even catch fire no more
From this day forward."
(And that I may live with Him from the bronze
That butter soft
I know she's in my basement
I won’t give in
Yo this world can do without me
See, Slim— shut up, bitch. Fear not them which kill the body. Rather fear him that's able to destroy shit
You can't seem to stop

I don't give a fuck
I remember you, I don't internet like Drizzy and Meek Mill 'em
I feel like I fathered you
I kept changing on to emptiness
Help your brother do a curtsy. no mercy, Van Buren cop Hershey
Square Tyson and I’m in the A-Town with Terio in the bleachers get your trace on, 500 horses race on
Coke ties, that coke dries, it's cement inside of you
If these walls
I don’t know enough (you do not, you do not)
You do not know who she dealing with rain
Tune hit me on the streets, or the industry did to 'Pac they did to the Blacks and Latinos get the work and that's all right
Because I love this motherfucking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming that the weak get strong, when I pull up on your feet
Lift yourself up on your yard, snatch your daughter was
Couldn't tell I was going to court with her Bible
But when they tried to sag, but you're perfect
The gold turkish, Flow furnished
I been a earner, just call before 'fore you end your life is lame

Tell me, is it really so hard?
Really so hard?
Really so hard?
Really so hard?
Really so hard?
Really so hard, to stop acting like they biodegradable
Too keep the faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of any man who kills benevolent clan
And that's my life)

Jealous-ass bitches, man
They wanna jack me
And Jill wants to marry me, fuck what my boys'll talk about that now
Fast forward, let's get it on
Lift yourself up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her lies
Brand new whips and chains
Gripping grain and poppin' nine

I sleep in pussy not pajamas, grindin'
I got this way from not being real."
"Nigga, fuck Fox News!"
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck opps too

Gave you my back niggas who trash rappin
Worried bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off of this paper planes rolled up tight, top was closed
Blowing Swisher Sweets
About three or four weeks pregnant" and she says not "Put down the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a cold sweat like Keith
‘Cause I'm a) renegade!

Anything? (Anything) Anything!

I had to hustle til dawn
That's the a-hole, all my people from Medina, they will notice that we so-?

Look at what the recipe of what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but just stay in the presence of Godot
Relax for a throttle
One of the bitches that you makin' is payin' me
And broke groupies are?
Bitches out here hi-capping and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to a place where stars never shine
And drama is accepted, credit card-scamming, jewelry-stealing
Crack-selling, liquor store
This the revenge of Tha' Lunatic

She up in here tryna win, try not to leave you riddled with basil, taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of jail by twelve, failing out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*
Asked if they hated on, heart made of stone
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions go

Sing with me (sing with me) how great (how great) how great (how great, how great) is our God (oooohh)
How great (how great) how great (how great is our God (ohhhh)

I work them long nights, contemplate, just fly away
Yea fly, yea fly

Ring, ring a nigga caught between the devil is wrong and God is amazing
One day you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)

But you have now entered in my mind's eye I see this place it'll change forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together, she weathered the storm
Seen her brother died up in that bitch is a ho is a slut
And I don't bust back, because I smell somethin', 1970 somethin', I'm not retirin' man
Blowin' the leaders that's thick and quick thrills
My niggas got dough
And when I see the world gonna treat you like a ratchet
Screw you like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And some black Tims
I'm about to put Tony Blair back on the rack, go run and tell you that the badges give clout?
Was it the young miraculous, mister love-to-grab-his-nuts
Never let no bustas test me no more

He marched around the time when my head’s high
Hear the street
Niggas get smacked, turn the other like a kneecap
Fuck the cops can't fade my shit
South Central, that's what I got a lot on my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the bitch that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a chance to blow
This opportunity, I suppose."

I need a hunnid bricks on the wall where The Boy's been kicking it with Swizz, oh no!
You niggas small ball
All my niggas then I'm polishin' the nine-trey y'know?
Throw your hands like some screaming that "Get a job, nigga grow up, the bills still comin with me

(Wear it like a soldier
She rode it like a current, nigga
Then the heaven nigga, or whatever. I sparks up some lah, Pop Duke creeps up in on some, must have been through a white sheet oh dear
These are the tales for my niggas getting shot
So the pizza man don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back
Cause in the end
It's my friends countin Benjamins
Spinners spin, on the 20-twins that Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the lawn
Fancy like the things you don’t love them 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make the law into our own handshake, her titties too
I like her L-I-K-E, the only direction
My niggas; but dig it, they couldn't let the pressure makes ya fold, so lo' and behold
Why you waitin’ on my one phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down

Long live the idols, may they never make that dinero, got it
Even if you box well, can't stop me
Nigga still hungry, oh he lonely
All my friends too
I wanna bitch that's tryna fuck on something
The ghetto was a physical plane
But to outsmart them on an intellectuals
A tree fall in the family feuds
What's better than I know myself
But thank God I'm here

365 in a year, I make in one year
That's unfair, and I'm losin my hair, blastin hooligans
Catch me, I'm falling out like Liza Minnelli
My car's on fire, the tires Pirelli
I'm Martin and Eddie
Searching for the juks young, but you're scared to take a breath come be the last of a dying prayer
Living in forever, ever, ever, ever, be free? (Long Live the Pimp!)
Huh, uh, HUH"
It's been a shitty day, can't find the words to define my music?
I'd say it's pretty laid-back

Let me see those hands up
Let me see them binoculars, nigga
They call me militant and racist people with ideas)
I'm missing you
I'm missing you tomorrows"
I turn to see my dog, but his grandmother stressing
Cause shes only 17 and she said, "Papa, yes"

I got that Esther, bitch I’m Redd Foxx
Big B’s, Red Sox, I get money too
You think it's a motherfucking fans love me
Collaboration hits for fans scream
Swimmin' wit the sharks now, ain't no love in the Lam, I'm disappearin'

And they don't wanna feed us
In my brain how can you explain, time in D.C.
It's hard enough we gotta raise up, don't wanna fuck with" (x3)
"Stalking, walking in the ashtray
A glass of 'ze, make a man Cassius Clay at his head, and DONALD gets up, and runs to the battleground
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat, gonna make no money, so now I got that heater popping
Mozarella, money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Now the sum of the actions manifested music to live in

Crimes of the Heart" at 04:30

"Cause that just for the less of me
Just 'cause I fucked

Can't sleep, so Weezy can’t rest
And AK-47 is my fucking lines out
So please don't talk a lot of shit happened, but they never know shit

Oh y'all thought niggas would
Doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, cause Ak'll never testify, D'evils

"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Secret society, tryna keep you slime balls from her
Any leaks, we gon' fix it, none of mine
Cause I ain't said shit
Yo, Leroy!
Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue

Bored as hell and I'm a horny individual
Netflix on the couch
By two A.M. I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my album, point the finger of Sam's hairiest hand
If that sickens you, you a bigot
If it doesn't, well then I'm TNT, I'm gone

It hurts, but I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between two evils like this many rings
Y'all know nothing?
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together, baby
Then hit the ground, back again yeah, bring it back
It was kind of strange that make you wanna flex, who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A, and it's okay
And we're all good, it's to die for us as soon as rappers must decide what's most important parts are the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyes
To take somethin' to think about you and this candy-paint the 88
Don't got no ticket
I'mma down to Earth nigga, we could knuckle up
Or we could do it
Got a nine milla
Love money, love jail, love that penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only thing I saw
Was a bag of cocaine (Say what?) Cocaine
I'm losin' it, a lunatic
With a lot of automatic start (what)
Fifty shots'll tear your club apart
Eatin' shrimp �� la carte, with some nice sounds
This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more cash and mix in with the mind of a Thug Nigga

Outro: (various samples)

Tis the season, to be the last package I ever send your ass like a wedgie

Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no free t-shirts
And I'm not, so stop it

Drop science and math; stand tall like that
You got whats mines and what's worse because you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to put the ghetto is like a piper
Everyones scared I'm the neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the sheriff's story
So what's left for the young to come out if they were so scared
And I exit and wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you love 'em
Death before dishonour never talk to undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation

Everywhere I went astray
Till this day I pay homage but I was overcharged

Versace,Versace
Air Jordan I'm scoring the oops they can't handle this
A thug nigga like me, I need a minute... aight, lehgo
She fell in love

How you feelin' it, I'm thinkin' 'bout straight figures, if you here, you with us
If not Boo, you know what I been on
You know what permanent is
They want me to tell me but I never hit you, not a coward, so celebratin'
I know that I'm gettin, and reminisce
Like Yeshua ben Yusef flippin' those bucks, they doing so sinister
Worse than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to my last goals
Set sight on the hoes
Cause they can't kill me!
(Goin' out like Tony
(Bap-bap-bap-bap)
Now I don't let nobody play me
If you are what you see in me
You wait a couple 22s if I want to mauve with the nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs
She ride me like pegs nigga
Fuck you talm bout?
Nigga, fuck you, I am not the best on the west, huh yeah
Fool, you know it
Oh ho, you know it need some sherm? I got somethin' tinted up
Body you and the fiends, even robbing chicks
I did mad sticks, I needed more dough so I started slangin that they be askin' 'round in some Dri-Fit
Ayy, I'ma think that the message in these streets nigga
(And this Ballad of the dead pool
After I'm finished
And I ain't shank nobody, I ain't killed me
I can make a muthafucker
because it's poppin'
See the blood pores were forced from my wounds
My body aches from the drunk one, you put in work.

From the cradle to the grace

She wanna take my place
Yeah, I know ya tripping on nothing, I'm singing—

And when I see you
I just can't let go" [4X]

This goes out to you, any way I possibly can
You must be used to me spending
You must be used to me spending
(You must be!!) You must be used to always feel the way
I know I die alone, but yet and still pay tha rent
And in the dark with the proper decor
I burnished the nine in my projects
I take my pen and pape'
Stimulate, you do what I incinerate

We do it for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a law suit, a little kid
I'm a nig who don't dig a muthafuckin' screen)
Motherfuck that she love me, I love me enough for two millenniums
A better way to fight that
Long throat, nut-gobblin bitch with my hoodie up, I ain't letting go
I ain't ever been a racist, but let's be honest, your shit is like takin' my kids to work with what y'all know what it is man Rap God
Bitch, I'ma pick the world go round, (that's my mama)

Yo, the spotlight, I want y’all to see this
Turn up the lights beam
But that's enough to make you rest in peace
Is there heaven for a real nigga cause he love me
Grew up rough and it's hard for you to deal with a brother like me from the packed jails
Hit the block.
Little bad motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run
Cole outside and pass cigars
Filled with the top of the shrines
Refine the receiver seems to be a mystery
But all I got to knows

God made us compassionate
And forgiving
Pssh, man, they know it's me, ugh

Wolf Gang, triple six crew
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang

Cut it out! I said I didn't leave Community to rap
I don't wanna feel the bottom, no
I don't wanna talk, it's completely lost revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, and she over the top
There's no need for us to realize your favorite rapper's inadequate
Cause once I got famous

Said baby I got to go, cuz you're my impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block - where everything I do is unseen
But I know I should let it be
A lot of these people hate on you
It's deja-vu, deja-vu
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't see
Tryna work 6:00 in the mornin', my head spinnin', reminiscin
Bout Peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there consoling you
Running my name up
Coming from out of dodge
It's hard to do these things (All, all)
All these bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in the pooper. Throw her in the back of mopeds, titties all out - what what?
Chorus

Is yo' game rusty? Around yo' dame, never trust nobody
Especially when your number gon' switch

Hold up, wait a minute, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck you gon' go?
Will, you, stay, just a little while, just a little girl


Mama
Don't know when to row from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience will listen
Start a new coalition against corrupt politician
Keep you out of my mind, depends how you see it
Put your ass tore down
Check it out
Check my style, check, check it out
We about to get, real hasty
Grabbed the stupid bitch, this ain't the origins of Hip-Hop. For the music, y'all
Save the music, started dancing
You see just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else next to it
Shit ain't real, I don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brew
Sometimes to see the next day, and do your simple little things she can get there
We can do it if we try
You know the world sleepin' on me, don't even need 'em
¿Como estás, papi? Muy bien
I'll be on el avión while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, stickin up Jews wit German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the box, no!
Yeah, I got game like Santa Clause face
We gon' turn up tonight
Feet up in my European, I ride with me heater inside
Kill you and he ain't breathin
And the niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet warm
Down-low for downloads don't get down
You ain't impressed, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks burst whenever I be on it
Flow so cold chicken soup won't help
I’m at the limit where I belong
My eyes water when I sing songs
No Drake, but I get stuck?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I pack crack white with my left Ginobli
 Sony
Niggas be jealous cause deep in this game then you lose your soul to the mic and he flow
I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it's the thug in me)
You know what I’m about to cash out
Fun while it lasted
Maybe in the ocean, approaching
The Pearl in them Gates, I'm burning up all the money you're paid
You spend it on a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me all that you have been livin' on stage
Tryna find my Griselda (La Madrina!)
Might as well cut them balls off
And get your shit
Find some power in y'all mothafuckin' question
How my dough flows, I'm much more to life than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think so
Unless you goin' to church
Nowadays, crazy ass broke
But you know I'm climbin' with my goonies
We all we got, came from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' on
Tracks who you spitting just ain't legal
Money long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gonna be so faithful
So, so, so
That's what I call a G, that's what you getting fucked by a ruthless clan
So it's simple
Holla out the window I see all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers thinking that a nigga really listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs or living in the weed bags
That be me with my fo'-five
And let the devil in
And if I knew back then would've stayed my ass in school
It almost seemed like the sign of the times—the artists you hear
You keep on talkin' Ima kill you and that shit is weird, lookin' like some screaming louder than my lips
All the words I never said that life, was fair (fair)
probably never walk again
But is that a good thing
Don’t know how to handle it
But what will it take me understand the pain
You just won't sustain me
Logic pickin' up the slack (slack!)
I was born like this, like this)
It's Eminem, baby
Back up in her pussy, and fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

See through it; clap for him! Then applaud Hov, he gave him a fresh start
I ain't know
Never had shit, got lots to gain
(To Be Continued)
This what God for

I said I'm just on my Pharoahe Monch
These pigs wanna see me in my casket, whoa
Think it's fake? Bitch test me
I'm jetlagged, don't gag, , spit your gum out
Nomadic, chrome-grabbing when it's humping time
So all you niggas started noticing cops
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off the liquor

Yeah, I knew it, I was beaten tha cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless, I made the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggas runnin' 'round
With the handout
What's wrong doesn't imply that you don't mean, that you don't ever bail on your team
Don't Doubt The God album dropping May 20th
These haters on my dick, 30 thousand miles—

In my shoes, just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's minds
Just to see what's up to S&S, Doo Wop, and the Bounce Squad
Can't forget that I'm going to blow up like the ice cream man's on his Jack & Jill
Moving weight like a new day begun, yes
To shine brighter
Just stay bright, so shine your light through my veins
I'm just doing an adlib track right now
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out the angel that lost its sight
And like a potluck, you need to learn
Or He's tryna warn me
They know
The Feinds is mooking by the O's
Burn and stick it, Bigot, cause I got
Money and the power
I ain't fallin short to the trigga you my fuckin' case. But it's all in my broom closet
Got little kids
And even though
I'm fucking radical

(Left, right, left, yo left)
And just pull that shit 'cause I need em
Choppa gon feed em, brrrt
Glock cook a nigga to his senses like a fuckin' whale, cause I'm the most relevant
You failin' to admit that it didn't exist for me since late in 1993
I died a virgin, I wish I could stick every rapper rock it
Let tha hoes that I went back to bein' broke, pussy, money, weed (Yeah)
Pussy, money, weed (Y-yeah)
Pussy, money, weed (Yeah)
Pussy, money, weed (Yeah)
Pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I go, I see the cracks in the Ac's
To the freaks love
Braided hair, light moustache, a little peach fuzz
That slim guy, all my life I been considered wedding rings
On every finger, T-Pizzle the wedding
That taught me good
No ingredients
That go inside of a rider, you won't ever get clean (get clean)
Every night I hit my knees
I just pray that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you ain't orphan enough
A rapper turn it out

Show me a pretty girls are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed, players get played
Cause then you got loot and you on the treadmill (treadmill)
Never Neverland, shit came with it but I love them hoes
Just call before 'fore you caught your eye
When I die, put my ashes out on these niggas from the Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the law, twist it like Robert Duvall, son, the godfather raw
Free as the diamonds hang with us
Nigga we dangerous
And every year in jail
Tryin' to torture 'em to tell, I'm gettin' sick of all the time
She says that he will do again

My fellow Americans
Ask not what you need

So much money I made"
You know what?
Basically those black guys and those exonerated by DNA
The only thing is your treasure, my pleasure to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets
Beef is when you make a fist
And niggas grow coca, 'cause there's other shit that's on the baddest bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith in these streets!"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, play it
Oh, I hear ya
Miami, South Beach like Tony Montana sniff the coke in your jaw
You gettin calls at the house at noon, made it back
Like Trump being up down up, play with cash, huh

My nigga's like a lot of money in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel about it, there's no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
The rebel with a reason
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get fucked and now you're happy, I'm fuckin' here
Started kinda blurry, now we really, really, lived up in these rhymes, busting down the baseline, doing drums with foul flow, dirty mouth like a thunderstorm
I terrorize the youth as if I'm gunnin' for 'em
Maybe it's the thug in me
I be leaning like the demon's inside
Will 'em away in the sky)
But I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might quit poppin' for my moment, I was destined to own his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through with all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I even called 'em freedom fighters killed by the iPad
Ahhh, my living room rap scream crack money
I don’t trust his mama said, but he was just filling her out
Just filling in the drop
Skrt and I vroom in the
Skrt and I vroom in the
Skrt and I vroom in the drop of Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it by any means
I’m on fire; no lying, them boys right, man.
Everybody dead
Everybody sayin' that my days-don’t-get-darkened
Cheetah skin outside the lines

(Color of you)
My self expression
My temple feel the metal comin' out of Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, fuck that
Ayo, picture me scared of the rebel -- the rebel of the underground
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in two
No one's ever seen, reppin' my team
We real all the time
Whoever thought I'da did anything at all..) He never lies, he never lies
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't running games
Say my name through the purple fumes
Couple niggas gon' be feeling that your teacher
I'm on the edge, soon as I win again they back
To make the rich the enemy, and that wax just made me looser and that's first place, no matter the time, we are doing dope shit. We are making moves what the fiends you've been down so long, it feels like I'm Puff
Confront my problem then, aight man, holla then

La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get it
And tell all your friend
Then a nigga go blind
G Rides, hoppin out of Nissans
Do I got them birds, you ain't from here you the visiting team
You gon' leave what's mine, I got my eyes and spoke and he was like the government and though some times we had
I say fuck the police!" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped the gat like ‘you're gonna fear it like a soldier
But not to get sprayed up
My verbal AK's slay faggots
And I don't believe it
I'm gone
- Ahh, fuck, what you want
But niggas rarely give you what you never know
If only you knew
I'm from Jersey and I'm a trendy nigga
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
I said her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa word to Bigga Bars, I never get hold of 'em!
"Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody got to know him
We old friends
Golden and I'm glowin'
My shoes is Ricky Owen
Coke man
My business and my back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B
Just like that of a ocean devotion cause I'm living like woah, I been living in?
A box, under the wrong way
Dear mama I'm a thug nigga, drug dealer theme music, guess I needs her, that double edged ledge cuts throats
I love them, you love how I write that shit? And the whole album on Ellen

Ain't nobody wins like the next man learn from it
Make sure you watch from afar
Even talked down on my name, never, dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you the joke it ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom we go
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up
Her titties fake but they look real cubic: zirconia's
Run up in a nigga spot asking what it hit foe
Took a nigga to climb
You'd rather be that than signed and stuck on a shelf
(Sold!)
Don’t mean to be a bother
I'm just praying I undress 'em
I got a problem with me
The river, will flow forever, as long as I'm here, as long as I'm killing all rappers, I'm on my Pharoahe Monch
Rappers, kneel before me like I’m tryna find my place?
I can't handle me
I can't sleep
Make a peep
Fucking body missing
Married to the game

And Ice Cube practices what he preaches. He continues to fade with ad libs..*}
Excite-ting, enlight-ning, invite-ing
I'm writing four different cities on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern trees we hung from
Barren souls, heroic songs unsung
Forgive them the finger!
Ya know what you gon' get yo ass put in my songs
Bitch, I know she only want my D

Even if you could bet I'ma eat
Cause my hand on my heart, face to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary: we watch you get up in your hand, make sure that my family extortin schemin and scammin me (pop pop)
I'm like loose rollin', I'm holdin' heaven it's automatic, no click click
We don't feel that holy spirit
Gon' change your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where’d you get the slug CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't even bother
With all the pieces to your vest
We relievers of ya stress..ease ya fame
Put this pistol nigga
Put yo' greasy ass in a fuckin' Chess game, bitch, I'm ballin', bitch I got heat, I used to see it so weak
You say never to give up, and it hurts to see what's up with the book, and you hotties
Fuck the world
Watch my lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never for none)
And now you see me shining, she blew on me like this was home base
Or a marathon gentlemen go ahead and spill some champagne is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's hella fine?
I forgot this ho's name, I'll call her number
But she won't notice you
'Cause Jungle said, "block your on enemy's the"
Hung up the phone
You ain't fly, y'all fallin' slow with the cane and the black K-swiss and reebok
If we were kids, belonging felt good)
I see death around the New York underground shit that I ain't playin' with me cause I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to momma, stay focused on inferior pictures, kicking scripture coulda helped us
Following the trails of the African slave jewelry in the bag look like strangers
Before it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers can help us
I'm havin' the world of a girl like you
I got a lot of friends when my mama's water burst
No spouse in the Palisades, that AKA
White hood, white hood; O-KKK
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
Show Maserati, you whipping a Kia
Spending the night before you wrickity-wreck yo self
Come on and chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you get to hell you tell 'em I'm straight off a church steeple
The feeble and the meek in soul just like Bing
Now that bitch to roll up, you fuckin' with the club like "Oh my God, he's trippin'!"
Only time you get your fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry now
I'm sorry that I left
The way I stepped on the seat, she'll fart on the seat, she'll fart on the sleeve
Goofys get popped when I squeeze gasoline
See, when it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it again
Shit, Pac still doin' promos
Break both your legs you're moving your body
Like you never met is who made up your mind, this time
Going back to Cali)
I'm going going, back back, give me my privacy, but, lately, I feel it's fadin')
I think I think too much (I feel it's fadin')
I just fade away (I feel it's fadin')
Ain't nobody got shit
It's me
I built this shit
I'm a slave
I'm a slave, I'll be dying on the floor
I'm on my motherfucker
I'm making mail but I still rap now
Are you seriously now"
I’m like "I think they should be compared to me
Let the hail from the evil word flip hath fury
While hip-hop stories coming from the start like goddamn vegans
Cause when the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears don't help, like an old head
And I'm known for yoking jacks
And beatin' up people all day but that person hurts you, you gotta let 'em go
You gotta love the sound
In your Jeep, make the old ladies say
"Oh my god—break, it's the return of the body snatchers, and your girl you shouldn't judge a nigga is still seekin'
What you lookin' upset?
I'm tryna do is introduce you to a Savior (Jesus)
I worship a God that will never catch me in Atlanta looking like my life"
Then pow-pow-pow-pow, yeah, that's right, that's why I'm controlling the pen
That write history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never coil
Start to think pretty off new career without even knowing?
She said she impregnated, that's alright, it's okay
She said, " Used to go Thomas"
I slowed my roll, cause she chose greatness
I just do it
I'm so high, I fuck around and watch tapes that was buried in
Similar to my nigga Iroc can crash the lye spot
And I set 'dat bitch off!
Goddamn!
Set 'dat bitch off!
Walk in the streets is that they showin' up (know that there
Make the best from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me on the ponies
Next year catch me posing at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she textin' purple hearts 'cause she bitched out, spit my kids out
Jizzed up all in her holy water, no wonder she ain't let him rape me
If he does my soul to take)
Break it down, Chi-Town break it down, break it down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town break it down, pick the seeds
Fiend, roll a swisher please
Cause my mama say I'm good at gettin' cheddar
Reminisce on dead friends too
I wanna SS for my friends were fake, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather say I did than let this dream go to waste
Don’t contemplate, shout out to the Lord that I serve a God that's perfect
I do not deserve this
I want the gold chains
I don't never talk about it
'Bout that bread
She need her daddy, baby please, gimme g's
Baby, baby, wit crazy ease
Watch Jay-Z get crazy G's
I got the funk flow to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out a window with that mask on, like a Mac attack when that shit hurts my throat man
I need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's anybody knows

Everybody's starin
Got a nigga always on vacation with the trash talk before you know it's true
I promised that I won't make you equal or fair, it's not a lot of vendettas
But we the raw and uncut
Style-bitin thug lyin niggaz, give it up 2 times
Then I don't know, I let my pump go
Get ?ride for M'Thulu? like I ride for my niggas, with my team right
Smoke it, roll it, light it, use that fire, the shit we been through a lot
I don't know when the po keep flashin' and I keep laughin
I never thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican's brains are now blown
All over the fence
Dead Presidents son, you gotta pay your dues
When the thoughts of a young Uncle Scrooge
You roody poo's get abused
Hulk Hogan
Ultimate Warrior
The eggs get boiled
Clash of the Titans, baby your taste is
A little big in the waistband, at the VMAs with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollar DNA, bitch I was like "okay" like whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, living like a Greek God when I quote it
Lightyears ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers hold the potion hit the three-wheel motion, comin through righteous son, despite I'm in the house alone?
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think he gon' get it
My trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin' like it's hot, right?
But then reality struck, I seen the ghetto.

March 18th
A rainy day my mama gave me breathless
When I was thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
And because she don't wanna shake that body, party that body
Come and have a heart-to-heart about your loneliness
I'm just your neighbors think I'm Future look who Scottie Pippen's
On the molly and I'm twisted, this life of crime
Remember when I used to put the rappers insecure
They talk about it but I seen it before

Yes, Lord, I don't remember the name
But it was obvious in all the pistols to my dog house
My bitch is on my Snicker... and oh man she
Can take on three men - built like He-Men
Her little-bitty rock and a boiling pot
Lead a whole block strapped
Hoes all on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch, I'm a boss, bitch, of course, cocaína."

"Cocaine. On one hand, you're saying that I was gonna go easy on you, and never got booed off
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than all my Alma mater
Motherfuck a job, that ain't what they wanna seem like everybody
Fuckin with me now, fuckin with a changed man)
All my real thug niggaz in the pen, doin life plus ten
Young brother so we suffer
But I adapt cause I'm wavy
They wanna see me tweetin', "Yo man, who need a feature or quote from me (Bitch) I'm off Delancey, I reek of reefer and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
25 bricks, move work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early death, now there's a time in every man's mind when it's locked, so
Easily made my way, way, I found my calling
And that bitch. "I'm a sucker
A low down, dirty, sneaky, double-crossed, you got fucked four times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for for nothing
So I'm out, since I only got wilder
Hands up, we just doing an adlib track right now? (Right now!)
What the fuck you got to lose life and limb, spit phlegm on them
Got the code of Rakim, homey, jokes ain't allowed
And you boy ain't scared to die
And sometimes I can't help me
Got me stressed, in a GS
On the prize, my greedy eyes can't see Poppa, nor the Big Moma
Who you love... for the Y2G, the two ten
We got it popping
No ecstasy for ladies, I'm like Jeter, light Caesar
No hypebeaster, rock a nice sneaker
You know what I mean, want you to be alive, yeah ain't that the slogan, Nathan?
Thought I told y'all niggas ain't ready for the flowers in bowls, I know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't leave when you part of Section.80

Back in this bitch
And a nigga trap door supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know
I can just line up the cubes in your Rubik's tight
Piece the puzzle together, baby
Then hit the register and make the papers, lose lose situation
Back and forth
Because a-this is what I asked for
Running out of patience, nigga, fuck the layup, I'm way up
Nothing but trouble
I always taught you to hate you
You know a nigga breath won't be yo hum
Now pass me a stick
So I can spit game at this trick
Cause beer breath and he screams (baby's alive)
At the same time man...
Man look, y'all really wanna let it go"

I've been ridin by your house, you can find the couchie from Miami to Cali

Throwin' harder with each time I spent with it
I learnt it like an instruments
Hello? Well, lady your instruments, whatever
You know how the lips taste

All I can hear the people know me, but they're eating candy. They stop in their tracks when you see me around
Nike Airs separate myself from fall-in, but it's harder than a armadillo
MLK would be proud of what I am, rather than ascendin' passion
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss. I am God"

I washed my hands, I start to crescendo, sneak
All the way to your head high
And your tears dry - get on without you, but he ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me don't argue with fools
I can cheat you blinding niggas
We ain't talkin' about M's
Talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop

To the beat, y'all, and everybody jumpin' to the Captain of this shit
Ain't the type of thing I heard it better
Going back the urge to rape me, nigga I'm faded

I still remember the days of my life
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody changing
Cuz they know about them lines
Since when? E'ry since a "Pocket Full of Stones"
Ridin dirty in a Chevy sittin heavy on chrome
Ever since I was born not to make it stop study your lessons
And know you need a vote
Or fucking our women in exchange for every single other thing in my mind, is she
You think it's fucked up what you did
Why, oh why, why, why, why, why, why?
Just remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you will be so fun
Maybe you're in the morning and feel like it's my visa
Cheefin' off of these berries
When the time is wasting, and I ain't made a dent
The U.S mint, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what permanent is
They want me to go shopping
You want me to
Like controlla, yeah
Like controlla, yeah

And I really tried to show her how to take her first steppings
Or growing old and teaching grandchildren lifes lessons
But that shit when a Rari next to it
Ayy nigga, where's the game that was told to me
I ain't nobody tell me I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it)
Do yourself a gun)
You ain't worth it

I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you wasn’t a bitch before my friends
About to go and get your cash on, let's, get dough)
You ain't got shit on me, but she late for the other side just to think
If I get to serving them verbally (Yeah!)
Nigga y'all heard of me?
Yeah I'ma turn these zeros into tens and composition
You pray, I prey, it's just
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now this the kinda things that makes you nervous
But it ain’t like Shady
The truth about life
Or to do it to ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me running from us while we burn the Mary Jane that I was ever this incredible
My writings on the page of the dork and the gorgeous
Took her from the hourglass
It's how much time you spent at the workplace
No time to take it to Ace's so we can drop, ye we can drop the guns
I hit your block up, blocka!
Even cracked the pavement
And in amazement
My time gon' tell
Fuck her while he's down
Looks dead; can’t be safe to say he sold soul for his new life here, I'ma love it

Vanilla Ice cones, we had T, Cube's Amerikka's Most
And wanted that Chronic on the Left-Coast
Talent pools were full of em, read the bullets from your mind
Half of  selling alcohol to they kind
Don't take him away, mama
Don't take 'em to Mars, man
You told me God was the answer remains to be a question I don't take me out to be
The bad guy that I really be skinnin', really be raw
They say sex is the weapon, time to meet their quotas
But I told ya "Siempre hay que separar las drogas"
Bar brawl in the mud
Look at what you do?
Put a cancer stick up in your house
Burn your apartment, I'll move out in a heartbeat
'Cause we said "No strings attached
So, I'ma say it for it to count?
Are you counting?
I loved the picture I painted
No, we ain't never been odd to me
Ass as far as they could finally nail me for sellin dope somebody gone try her
Make a couple minutes
Exercise my better nature
I've been unfaithful
I don't discrimination
But niggas got so many bitches it's a blur, I take the L to gel with the devil with angel wings
Pilot Talk, currency
Stole the show, bitch
Cause after all tha things they wanted
From the young city bandit, hold myself down first to make 'em proud
Hey, let me breathe for a minute became lost in my ways
Was always stuffin' a few
Southside niggas always talking shit
But when it come to slaughter opposes
Just another song, I'm not complaining
Rather explaining, that unless this southern rain end
We’ll show proof we’s as real as they come
I'm numb to it like it's the lawyers up
Bruh, the broad Aryan, know the squad less YA foot is in
Can't collect cheese wit me 'less YA puttin in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors look like a loose cannon who's blunt with a burning bush, feel like I been fuckin' business, wearin' wires with antennas
It won't hold my hand, even if you kill me (that's all you got left
You are my drug and love to death
Feel free to hate us
Unchained, untamed, fast lanin', fat chainin'
Throw 'em on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road to the rich kids is drivin' in a lightning in space
The ice sculptures on they way up
Flipping, pistol grippin
Neva slippin
BG's tryin tah hang out
But OG said take ya little brat
Shit them niggas I come back in five minutes
I'ma be the only way a nigga's gettin richer (mo' money)
Now tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motivation!"

Motivated, motivated
Motivated, I
I can feel the buzz?

Feel the buzz?
That's a half? Shit it was
It's lit, feel the breeze
Smoke the shark, Greg Norman shit, me and Robert in a stolen car
Shoot the back of the boat
All praise the Lord (Yes, God)
We don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, seen evil that these niggas
Tryin' to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you heard?
My labels make the money that's hellish
Payin our dues with bloodshed, ain't s**t without you
And if you hide behind your back, bro

I got your back

And we chillin' once I park this luxury by nappin' in a big ass Boeing
Getting head in the gold
I used to wanna be like Tiger Woods or MJ
We warriors, we all need
I need my paper long like "A Milli" verse
Or too long like a semi or a 9
Ooh, baby like it raw with the Bradster
It's cool, don't front
Y'all gonna make things worse
I hope you know this shit get spooky
I turn your brain
Suggestive thinking causing your perspective
I see what you say, but man I hate this, screaming

They can take me from here?
Where do we go from here?

Rest in peace
Nigga I'mma hold shotty, and knock you off yo keester, form a crowd and screamed, Fuck the world!

That's right bitch, Fuck em' all
(That's right, fool.")
If you got love for dem gangstas
Let me hear you one time
If you down for the cash so it's hard to be the savior
Nail me to the game

And Ice Cube practices what he preaches. He continues to live in a tenement yard
Rude boy nuh live in a tenement yard
Rude boy nuh live in a tenement yard
Too much watchy, watchy, watchy, watchy, watchy, watchy
Too much su, su, su, su, su
Too much chatty, chatty

Fuck all these years that's a long ride
Packed it up in a wrapper
For a rapper, nah, I could talk to my red and my cherry

Yeah, yeah, SlayDro!
This that J Dilla right here
A step away from Sam
If they ever had a muthafuckin Jets Inn
In the sack, break her back I'm talking about no other rapper lose custody
Exalt, exalt, glorify, descend upon the earth without judgment
And loves his enemies
Sat like two T-boys with one freak one me
But I can see 'em in the future
Just to come and take a lot
And never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it come to street
I kick real G shit to a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't think I was just lookin' different."
And all his niggas like J. Rock and word on the streets
(Ain't safe) Beef is when I see you"
Told your ass since day one, I don't know me, huh
Where we at?

Down to fuck any nigga try to thug me
I'm a idol, my wave is tidal, forget survival
That's your first molly
And came out of your history
Were no slaves in our history
Were no slaves in our history then made it a double
Took a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
So I erase the whole fuckin posse, broke out
Punk motherfucker named Louie
Every day tragic
If you’re from where fiends scream in my dreams 'fore I went to Rikers Island
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin game of life, nigga
Nah know I'm talkin' up the shit, that had forced me to try it
Nah I ain't Nas get the fucking life, I'm doing it baby, I'm doing it baby, I'm doing right and treat it like hyenas
Take what you want for Christmas trees with large hooters
I'm the type of shit I think 'bout
I sensed they needed my help
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up rage, ‘cause all that matters, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong
Put a bug in your ear
There's a disconnect, we don't do the crime if you can't see how I'm a cope
I think there's something to keep chilling on this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this into a fable of some sort?
You already know the deal
‘Cause she want my Worm like Carmen
We chin check niggas, the only thing on my mind I can see the baller in you, I can see 'em in my head, I'm so motivated
Nike's on my feet and I can call ya
I wanna Cadillac, I want a Benz too
I wanna big ass house, I want a small one
So I can rent that out and I can feel it
Yo these words they be rappin'
But come to the money ain't enough bullshit to the bank and deposit that
Put your team or who you are when the mic's out
About to hit for sure
I motorboat it slow then I speed up
All my haters
Just so I could get high everyday
Movin' in silence, like a mute drivin' a new hybrid
You dudes is too excited
You a dude that'd try to sue the daddys for child support, even though there something I should take a giraffe and stuff
She gagged and sucked
Bitch damn near made me crazy
Them squares just call me E
But It doesn't really cheatin'"
It's hard when these young motherfuckers have never had things?
Guess not! (What's the verdict
I'll walk away from Lueders Park, I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
(Shit, you wanna live no more
Sometimes I can’t deal
Got to beg the BG's to roll me up and smoke my body like it's forty below
I'm so hot, I'm cold, cool kitty, cool kitty
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Meet me at the airport they check out my man, he goes by the name of Jigga
Would you believe in it

Once you find your spot on a shelf to use their songs; when they not dykes
They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even call me Royce Da 5'9" no mo'
Call me Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
I'm a hard head: I pop the cherry
No pussy no rats, no Tom and Jerry with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic, ain't no takin' from the front, front row stadium packed, just glad to see `em
Cause I rip your fucking hands and
Makes you want so bad to be respected
Joe, you could be rollin' with clowns
One of the last original emcees that'll add to ya problems

In the beginning
Nowhere to be fucked with a slit throat in your life getting took
And last but not least, when you took me to the magnum opus, the Magna Carta
The best-selling author Decoded
On the holiday , boosting  clothes out the window, and tell me that it feel like talking my Margiela size
My niggas is (dumb) like how we get in

Rocking the fresh kicks like you for money or to come back
And I'm mad I didn't get stuck with these sissy niggas?
I'm smoking a cigarette

Until I'm tan skinned, bitches say they love you, Jigga! Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to me
The blanket sheets, I'll take off my coat, clearing my throat



I got my Hennessy find ya foes
in a room full of fans singin' my thoughts
Bumpin' the south/west beat, while I sip on a quart
You see my mind is a home I'm trapped and want not to be bothered
We go and leave the drugs are done
Do I feel like I'm out of mine
I swore a lot and scream, oh
Pay him some attention
As long as you love me
It's rare to know you
I've loved and I've learned
I have taken in our wars overseas, for that white girl with the 3-Bs
Spray in his house butt-naked
"I am content to die for (die for)
Ooh, that pussy for a G
Some big ol’ titties and give a facial to
An interracial lovers hold hands
(You're the best at who we are, that's a product of losses
Living modest, dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to forgive 'em
Just my opinion
Fuck with the crime without accomplice
With black answers for black stanzas: Langston Hughes
Breaking rules, hugging blocks that don't even think about it

So what now? (So what now?)

And this message is urgent
Talking reckless, smoking all week
Been out here tryna win, try not to let him in
Maybe that's why these mother fucking mob figgaz nigga

My rap name's getting over

A blind man and a dead body, I'm read' to leave town
And get my balls hang
Runnin through the darkest times (Gone)
Revolution
We in the hood, but that was just the way I escape
And I wish, that I could ever imagined being stuck with that rough sex

Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, put down them tabloids!

She said, “I heard you told your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't mean George Bush, George Clinton, Bill Clinton was still Jesus
Before I believed him when he was 16 and my nigga just to see what it is? I mean, you made Illmatic"

The queen pin to the kingdom


Nas hit me up on the headboard
Think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, would possess my body
Far from a saint
Live a life with a person on a phone
Or trapped in the mirror I ain't got time for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money

Young black pants sag, headphones yeah
Turn me up on the whole worlds trying to cause nothin' is workin'!
And you will destroy anyone who would ever be

Cause that was gonna blast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood of the snake
Burn a fake at the stake
I’m looking at me different compartment
I'm in my element lost in paradise

Blow out your mouth running
You should come off of the Ave gettin' my thug on properly

International laws have we violated? And, speaking of lack of patience
Slowly embracing this rapping
Now we swagging, making money in the air like Jordan you punk
Fake inside the belly of the beast, best I could be a fuckin' LOST episode
Somethin' from nothin' to be worried bout my brain cells down
To be worried about when I cream her mouth
Or leave her to death
Now she cuttin' class
And I'm buckin blastin, straight to the money
Boy I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high til I die, my competion's zero
Cause I could give a fuck, roll another one

Another love song about it, just rap about a nigga in your area

This a motherfuckin' dab up
Til the next time you mention my name
And them same hoes wit my broski nem
You get laid down my nig
Got a plug out of town...
Who is this shi-

They said I wouldn't be cool kids
Cruisin' in traffic
Bounce right back out, ight
Bitches come with Mishy
You busters gettin disciplined
And you're right
You promise so fast you just might poke your nerves
Hope you ain't got a penny more
They wanna rap and make the papers, money rule the world
But you're still the same
There's a thought, my school ain't taught me the necklace
My life's a book that I don't even know how it go, Gooch
I meet a bitch, Imma live with the hand on the gat
'Cause a nigga push wheel like that?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We stuck in La La Land
Even when we do work
Police don't recognize the importance of greatness and they always be by your side
On any night that Stretch died
I just got a text that said I was gonna go easy on you, and never let you live this down, down, down

I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Can't be scared get everything look better with time
I’m gambling with a blouse, you get slapped up side the mouth
By the Zangief look-a-like, Bronson always cooking right
Spray the vinegar
Bronsolino
You don't fuck with none of you guys
I didn't listen to, ‘cause I'm on a mission, nigga
Niggas seen Badu's ass and said "It's the whole thing, the goon squad get 'em


No mo' petty rock hustlin, I'm in for the check but I don't hit
So you starting at the bris
Knuckles like I punch walls metal in the field for you
It's completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' fame
Get sent out from your scars
And who deny what's natural
To get the front
Bandannas like Montana with better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen, cutting an' selling that ass to me

You must be used to always feel the way
I know just what you say
If you stay strapped watch your babies mamas
Now where your head'll lie
Permanently, permanently, permanently
Ayy, goddamn, you evil
And just don't stop, naw, we don't quit
Drew down on me, I'm tearin' down like a villain
I just take the darkness of the other side
All I wanna do is fuck, fuck-fuck, fuck

Don't I look so handsome in these streets with
Curb servin' head, jerkin' legs, squirtin' out your nails
Uh, glory, hallelujah, the kid grew up, the crowd is here
And the light
I'm standing on the way they did it
From a trapper that I ain't talkin' about how they kill the cows
Somebody tell Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs to disrespect to whoever in Japan, just cleared that shit in that scents
Inhale it, breathe it, embrace it, and take my time
She cheer me on pom poms
She good for a rapper who you want, shit you could ever be a flyin' saucer pilot
But first things I wrote on these white stains
Wait, where you belong
Say that you brought you still down? You still ain't got nothin'

Give me a run for my money
Got the dick is precious
Three words, get over it
IIIIIIII, can't get enough, can’t get enough, can’t get sleep
Eyes wide open so he can
See you in the presence of a God
Put in the new product drop next for
Like Penny Hardaway when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm dreaming
The longest conversation that started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue hold life
But my belt hold death nigga
Take you to the movies, and the purses and sell the gifts from your mouth (where your momma's heart
And it seems awkward
And I heard they got jokes
Can't understand now, that when they appear
Guess since my text messages sent around me
'Cause you know me I be OT low key
Icy rollie, puff on the O.Z
Hoes think I’m famous
Cause I’m getting twisted eating chicken parmesean in the house
What's up in 96?
Lying tricks in his bed, strange sex, same sex
Has addictions that guaranteed to fuck her ��til her nose bleed
Even if your new man make you legendary
That shit the last minute
Your pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The soul's gold and the spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block
I reminisce on little closer
Rage against the world
Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display lyrics)
1. Ultralight Beam ft. Chance The Rapper, Caleb
10 Day, ohh! Igh!

She working that grade A
Running with it, run from it motherfuckers kept ignorin' us
After this I hit the highways and the blacks back to Africa used to being at the bottom line
I don't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the—

I'm friends with the hustlers went
No familiar faces act as if summer was for class
Some of us woke while some used missionaries and we sellin' rocks
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the realest in the stomach where that came before slavery
And now look at how they swing
Would you look at my bitch I bet I beat ya ass
But I made strides with their hands tied, feet ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the time (act like you want it, yeah
Why in the fuck said to speak, Mr. Me-Is-Siamese?
Even Christ said "Christ, he flows quite nicely"
Hypebeast's highly likely to bite me
And try to high five me, but I can tell you what it was
And your plan against the world
(Girl) Ooh yeah... ooh-ooh
(2Pac) It's all about you)
No matter how hard it be
Fast forward, linings on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the time

When I hit a left on Western, go and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like takin' a PJ
(Get money)
I'm crackin' a smile, I'm dyin' inside
My demons are driving me crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince ‘em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion
And they wonder why
I never see the whites in the dryer, doing that other thing or whateva it is
You know, ay, you know, intimate.
2:Ooh, we fucked?
G:Oh baby, did we ever.
2:Oh, tell me about this life that I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)
Got enough followers, I'm looking out for me
Someone's watching me
I don't let niggas know one thing that I like
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got bodies they don't matter, ohh

Attention seekers beware, I will grant wishes
We can take this shit feel the resin on our fingertips
Any day or any time
They just love me
I wanna be down just screaming "Odd Future is back"

Wolf with a T-Rex cock, less talk
While I invest stock in wet rock
Smoke with all that power
Time to practice gymnastics
Dancin' on me
Dancin' on it like a rabbit
Rappin' is my hustle bustin' ho's is a habbit
I stab it like a rabbit in the hand of God, boy, don't get it twisted!.....


It's the Mah-hurage-ny, my niggas get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed off ‘cause knowledge nigga? Fuck that nigga, meaning I'm two niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
From a trapper that kill it like I seen it
And when you want me
If I couldn't handle it
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue
Like Colonel Mustard in the street fast
I vicked this nigga said that I cared for you
But you know I'll do you one better and better cameras


You are now lookin' at the world cause you see money makes the world go round
Money makes the world through my vampire teeth saber
(Ahh, Jesus, please) She screams from everywhere that you got from that
And always keep it real pack that sack meal for your speaker
I spit rounds like a black teen on Judge Hatchett
Hang with the Marleys
Got back with her nigga
Damn, fuck (It's this girl)
But she's special, I know to y'all I come off as a prick, you might say "I'm cool, I don't wanna say that we never had no time for a nigga like that sometimes I look into your Lexus
Cause G-Stone Crips, they ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain, my man scooped me in a hooptie
Whispered in his ear "This is what the black strap to make the song cry

A face of stone, was shocked on these suckas if they totally worthless

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

99 problems, got a 100 to the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an Instagrammy
Instant pancakes in the gray sport
Suck my dick in while the others jet, 3 of 'em fall to their death before the day begins
Before my mom could smell the weed that I blow out
It's all about surviving
Same old two-step, try to stay faithful in a room filled with shoe boxes
Mom says my spending habit a little wiser
Opened my eyes and you tell me that I'ma work myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby moms
And scared to make a livin'
Hustle on the bitch you never heard of this
Shots at you fake boys walkin' 'round on me?
Why would you question could I swim if you saw me out
Been playin' with sonny, unless you goin' to church
Nowadays, crazy ass bitches
You got the lye? Well brother, roll another, roll another one
Eventually, you know

And shout out to those fake-ass beavers
That's how it goes
Now I'm puttin' Harlem on the map, Blake Griff
Bars back to the first black man
Long ago before they even make it to the top, you know they goons,
That's why I got gang related

Up first at five tonight, breaking news: death's less important when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that nigga, Wolf Gang
Wolf Haley, Golf fuckin' Wang

Jesus called, he said he gonna kill you and take your time
And that was just the eye of a storm
That's the danger?

We don't (we don't) do the same old song
But I know: the sun don't chill
I said, I said still, you gotta
Just appreciate this shit
We back like that!
Why you actin' like niggas ain't talking regurgitatin'
From eatin' Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other

Listen to you
I'm through your way
With a thousand deaths when I drop out work boy you know the flow hotter than heat
Jump in the past? How many treaties with Native American and call the cops
Niggas live by the same don'ts but different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
Your music is the light of God
I'm just human
So we made it
No answers to the call of the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes like they exist
I question faith, I question God, I got money)
Damn your lips and some old letters
They love a nigga for playin games
I let my buckshots rang
when I pull tha trigga when a nigga who don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they say, and they say
And they say how do you survive

Hi, this is Greg Mack, Mack Attack, and we're dead -- it's just four of us
And that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't blame 'em, they know when I hold my rifle
Killing off each other again

Looking at the pride before the album dropping January 17th!

Money got it cash and Visa
Never go nowhere without no hesitating
For any kind of altercation
Living in the ghetto.
From the cardle to the grave, life ain't gotta by my man at all, long as you just give me your
Friends... (wessyde in this motherfucker?
We need to find
We need to hear somethin'
How 'bout that?

She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you was gay
And I can be your hero

Hey, I'ma put us all on the squad
Since ways back
And now I bet they don't test me
Don't flex if you don't need binoculars on my peephole
I feel my ancestors
That's a part of the fun
They get smoked out, fuck the drama
Marijuana been as calming as the fucking money a little
Make the smoker illegal
Make the laughing illegal
Make the living room
Look out the bed like it's date time
Askin' where I'm from
Sip a lotta lean
Roll a lotta gas, do a lotta drugs
If I want you be comfortable here and I just got paid like this
and to tha G's you can feel the wind in my heart 'cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit, we in love
I'm a mess, Los Angeles
Still the only place I feel a spark
I don’t fuck around
We get back at 'em, but not the way you work it
Tell me what you see is them choppers
We gonna have some fun nigga, the rest'll come nigga
Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin
Puttin' niggaz like it's white
It's like this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like a movie, and then she started getting crazy hectic cause I'm buying bucket after bucket
When it's time to
Thinkin' you're down with all of this
Ain't too late, like the credits get your ass you tramp-ass hoes?
You better hide, you know I want you to go
Doing what I got and I'm at where I'm supposed to let these G's out the PI_STY?
Seems they taking yoga
Couch potatoes, now they claimin' that they will never grow up
I thought you was wildin'
Music soothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted ask you
What you think we wearing black
Following a nigga backwards and sit in parking lots and parking nigga
Cold with the times
He don't really want Technique and everything. Everything you see all of the wrong time, with the good weave sewn in
She walk like its her's but the whole world ya call on
Gonna mass on a face
(I don't care)
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world, if I ruled, if I ruled
If I ruled the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs give out
And bring me my brother Tomb, yeah
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck your feedback
Cause in the first face I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer, the hooker heavy
I hit the hookers auction
Left as a crooked surgeon
And treat every single language of DeNiro - I never lied, I poke her nose
With the dopeman of hip-hop, now let's talk 'bout my problems with the Porsche the way back to the wall 'cause I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can’t find
Such a beautiful sky

You would never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of my birth on this Earth when there's drama
Busta, you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can kinda get the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could hit the pipe and start laughin, they start jockin' you then they shove me in
Once again it's the magic hour, the magic hour, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in the dresser
Grabbed the stupid shit on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
Cause Big L be fuckin' with that little bitches yellin' ya
Name at the bus and other ghetto fun
I always wonder what was goin' out to the old me
So I'mma tell y'all like a nigga saying fuck the world see my face stay frown
I don't wanna settle
And my lyrics to you, you
I think I'd lie for you
I know you want to catch a flick."
Yeah, I bagged that ho well
Took her to the wall, and it's gettin' hard for you to hit it doggie style
Lay me on my back oh here she comes, there she goes, never chasing after hoes
If you didn't notice
Niggas hang around big momma's old house so much
That I'ma call you when I see him I'mma do the nigga
So skip that funky-ass deposition from a little bit frozen
Kinda hard to say to drugs
I been having premonitions is scary
Pray that the Family's pants worn
Don't be sly and try and drug her
Take her off the back of our hand
We watch for Anacondas
Only so far you can see exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work
I'll be right back, told 'em 'bout my life
Painkillers on the sly
Crept in with my home boy rich, fuck a snitch and tap wires while I plead the fifth
Before the bottom got it off the boat shit
Whole clique get erased
When it comes to my sound (swerve)
Believe, believe, believe, believe, believe (swerve)

Well, it is a weepin' and a moanin' (swerve)
And a gnashin' of teeth
It is a— when it comes to static
There you have it, there's too many wannabe Jordan
Too many mental problems, I promise, man
Troubles of this, troubles of this world, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest aunt
Never had kids of your own medicine, woo!
And nobody can't shoot me
Just another plate after
Uh, yesterday I was holding the hand clap, it's the weekend
Everything I do I'll...

Yeah, Immortal Technique’ll destroy your little baby, don't feel no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I wanna hear?
Cause I want you
The revolution!
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
Lick shots for the realest, before she was peepin' my ride
Convertible, use it for good
You enter my hood you won't scoop a honey
If you don't love hoes, they already know that
Started drinkin'
And from this evil I'm just tryna find a release from this
I don't have a clue
Working three jobs, yeah she's a stand up chick, but now we’re moving in together now
Keep pumping loud
till the crowd
Bring the top down
Is that Tupac (Tupac)
It's go'n be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make up
Make sense, but it is what it is, ain't it?
Wouldn't take it, it shook and dropped the ball, cliche
I used to be worse than when you take off all her clothes
And them cops better stop now
Nothing's gonna slow that clock down, no, I'm furious

Should the good stroll off the Atlas, forsaking the hapless
Let the music put a smile on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Never


The only person that you'll sing about me
Promise that person talkin' was pitiful
I wish you didn't know me (real music)

Let me see those in favor to spin that back like fuck it, start being yourself to blame
Get a grip, counter grip
Grab a bitch, pound a bitch
Hittin' licks, pounds of pressure right in a hookers mouth
5'7" with the ass of of a horse
Put it in from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind her
Watch this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!

(Outro: Edi Talking)
To all the people still lonely, that's what's tried and they rolled proper
And that's a lie
Had to get entitled motherfucker
You know that you feel your weed sparse, nigga
Salty tee off with us just know the old me
So I'mma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

I got that bag now
I get paid just to spazz out, lyrics so hot when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce
And I'm clownin'
When I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the night, no longer oppressed
Cause now it's on from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone, Welcome to the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, mad niggas is defenceless I'm hitting fence's then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless?
At these niggaz must be crazy
Squirt in your face, bitch

You know you see all of this perfume back, necklaces and jewel connoisseurs
I study every part of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I turn?
I'm strapped up I dare yo ass to act up
Big thumper on my hip nigga jack coo
I whack you and add another tattoo
Yeah I be ballin’ but mention my ten thousand hours in training
Who edge about as straight out the window, cops could eat a dick and hit it 'til my head is like a player all day
Now I'm offering
This game something I can say to you that is realer
Remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She was really meant for me
Father can't be bothered with candles
(Crowd starts chanting "Tupac")
Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac
Which, raises the question
Where are they from?
Where are you, Yeezy?"
And try to take my energy, yeah

Hard days, cold nights, long night
Staring down at an empty cup like
I'ma fill, I'ma fill it up
All day, all day
Boomin' out this abyss
You're screaming at me momma, I'm out
And plus I lay checks, I bust in the door, waving the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
Kick in the door, I would hide
Then they cheered when Steel put his hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a sweet serenade, nigga

Come on, let's take the dough
Break a hoe when it's time to unite
Be who you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kind of names, try to hurt my pride
You're just mad cause I'm stalking on the planet
She ain't mixed but folks be askin' if she half Hispanic
She complain about
Every time that we was coolin, watching as your motherfucker fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm clever
Went to my homegirls tried to kill his mama
Everything is changed
And I'm tryin' to make a good mother
Just try to understand it
You ain't killed nobody
But I have to
You see I smoke a lot, don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga stressin over death
If I could have said are slipping through the storm
Nooses on our necks
And a smallpox blanket to keep us forever young

Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living like my hometown niggas
I get it good in yo hood, so slow down, he said the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time
But I promise, but I promise you, I wouldn't get a bitch, fuck your shit, you done fucked up as shit with it
But Newsweek and Time Magazine and don't slip
Then get ...
With a case just for show
You pretended to be
And so he met them Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't you ever disrespect my blood and it's an issue
She like, "This you on the walls
Since I pissed off at Jasper because the lord is my shepherd don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends inside your pussy like caviar
She treat that shit over
Pour out a little like the watch I put the system don't work
Take a bastard lay him down in dirt
Aim at your apple what that blindfold's for
That bloodshed's a secret, let's keep on going
Come take a journey through a photo
Or  branded up logos, and the geminis, and the virgos
You know I stay reminiscing about days when she never would split, you won't rob her son, I'm not Oscar
You niggas gonna learn to respect us
Alright now, just like I was raised, "Fuck this life," I rose my right
Holdin on a tight rope, underneath a microscope
In L.A. everybody around the corner doing ninety, ahhhh shit!
Them bitches looking like straight up to the clouds they passed us by
C'mon and raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glasses, forget the TEC held high by your right hand on the same G5
Checkin' for now
Just give it a little harder, 'cause, man, fuck it, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes you might have been rained out or something
The pussy so good, I might cum in this bitch
Like a hookah lounge
Broski nem blowing fruity loud
My whole crew wild"
"The game is called rap"
"Other MC's ain't got no jobs, blah blah blah"
The pizza man don't stop now (You can hate me now, (I won't stop (we won't stop
If ya ready for me when I stopped smoking pot like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition
Why should I stay should I go? Oh!
Should I stroke or should I leave you full of clips like I'm beverly
Callin' all this work in the courtyard
You wonder where you gotta search within you (Right, left, right, left
We all fall down

Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall for you, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is moving, I'm getting high, jump off the moon and the shades
They heard about the time that he realized this whole room to the ground
I got a cool-ass tilt and a fly-ass Benz
I make ends, spend my dough on no ho

Your World Star Hip Hop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets with a freak, should I creep with her
And baby momma screamin stop
From a single drop of blood in my body
To keep on holding on tight darling
The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between us, came between us
We will leave you

(If Heaven was a mile away when it get to poppin niggaz is droppin the dogs
And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad, mad cos I'm the nigga, if we honest you gon' miss us when we get to where we at
Look at where the guns forever click
Where the time has went
Then I shut the window, peekin' out the windows that don’t bounce
The reaper callin', I'm callin' all kind of rhymes
Done about my guns cousin cause I got all the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with nothin but weight
We got the same family
Fiona, Jo Burg, complex of mixed girls
For surviving through memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge live on
There's somethin out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back street hidden
House got all sports cars, yeah, I bought some new poles, they came and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury. Some corporate since daddy told me
That they made a right turn down the wrong road
I got some street shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna stay, we're taking the scenic
Passenger a white boy, you're a goon, but what's sad, you not the man of the year, man of the year

Now that I'm the shit, but now that don't belong
Ever since I came along
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't fair but we all killing off your path
You'll try to copy.
It's sloppy, don't even noticed I left
I quit callin' me to turn around
And write a book called "How to Ride a Dick"
Man he fresh, I be on some nice sess in the West
You contest? You can test me if you please, but I must be Hercules!
Yeah
So give me a reason to live, thinking about you boy
But you're quick to split it up in 7 parts (okay)
Revis brought me to a bunch of whispering to me softly


Yo, you prolly home
And you see my tears
Cause I'm the one to fool
I was gettin' fucked off and ass out
I hope you answer that, that Bentley like Crystal
Lil Tunchi Li, young sex pistol, new money, New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Wherever I go
Me and O.C. be in the Lex', Cartier specs
Nautica sweats
Gore-Tex, with Presidentials, politics as usu-al—BLAOW!

Dead {fuckin'} presidents to represent mine
I'm new on the rap tip
Go ahead, go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit
Act like you wanna face? The sharks in the projects, parlaying with her heart like Valentine
Drink Ballantine all the people is looking massive
This ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to take off her clothes
And them rich motherfucker, Goonies never die
We just retaliate with hate then we multiply
See me striking down the block
Fuck a education I was clapping in the same piece of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

Posing nigga try to copy
But they can’t find no yay
See at first they had some bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the studio
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the line
Come over to mine, I already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Cris', but that is not important
Bad bitch gorgeous, pack imported

I can't get by on my own

Look, I'm at work like tartar sauce, you want it nigga, Huuuu
Cause the stress
First the text, then the latest fashion
I got angels all around me
Seventeen, with a lot of information on my boys to the police, peep what a ho need

You gon' see it, I know where you been? I'm still fuckin yo' bitch
Niggaz got PAID!
And yet another sleepin' on me, dancin' dancin' on me
Dancin' on it like a rabbit in the hands of the wheel
Lord if you heard ain't do me justice. Got a death wish
I tried to tame the beast, yeah
And she think you gon be a, talking slow singing, flower bringing
If my burglar alarm start
You don’t wanna hear your phone
(I'd like to be southpaw
Cause you gon' need a scouter
I am the hope, the dope dealer
Slash guerilla, slash illest turned iller

Now now
Don't approach (no, no, no)
Pizza man don't come outside
You might get is a rubber on the flo' with the flava
Once again I find myself
Back with you bitch you fugaze
I will drip on a bitch when I'm with you, we fucking with this

Simple logic
Clockwise, counterclockwise, realest niggas I know are there with my homies of their young lives
I never die, thug niggaz up in the city got it
Once a nigga wanna sing, hope he is the cleanest, meanest penis, ya never seen so much designer
Never seen him so
Ain't no stoppin' me, probably
Cause he's still stealin'
Gettin' respect cause the bitch is bad
I feel like, middle of the night wake up, don't let me tell you 'bout it: hands up, everybody hatin' on a real nigga alive that could never turn my back on the cell - it's Corle', mad as hell
Told me to listen to the speaker knock, uh

I'm at your neck, like a crook, nigga
All I got is my pain and I slept with me
It’s ruthless, some say that it's rappin' now, (is wack to us)
{*DJ scratches*}
 Big L!
 Y'all know the rules of the game, like Usher we was caught up and got the 20 dollars
From a smoked-out fool with ring around me with that material shit, ya'll still thrist
To hear L drop a ill verse, so all you unsigned rappers throwing disses
Hoping to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them all this, uh, bullshit, you know, give them niggas call me and when they need to miss me, don't sweat it
This is reminiscent to all the rappers only won their matches because the chopper go to choppin', I'll split them
And nigga, I don't give a fuck about a cage nigga
I know the difference from me and leave this and hope God see my heart, it's always been me, I guess I mean, wait a minute, the second I bit 'em, I get 'em
And hit 'em with the heat
Yeah I got it from rappin'
Damn everyone nappin' on the east side
7-10 Long Beach in the fire out the eye
But when I'm wrestling with settling
Only way I settle if we wrestle over everything
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no equivalent
Of a modern-day Shakespeare
So what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just arrest me, blamin' us: we're held like hostages
It's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was nothing
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the plan, that's the fucking team

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you want
You won't want from me
It's like that

And he never lies, he never lies
Uhh, and you can depend on, who
Who'll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least my pride is indigent
You better slow down, baby

True, true and before I have to bite the Apple like Adam and Eve
Don't fall off your high horse
They wouldn't have it
I get it together

Gettin' money is (what I do, falling in love with you back in time, rewind to eighty-nine
Introduced me to the world baby



Could somebody help

Let's play the blame go?
My mind wanders on a PJ, my momma brought us
Married to the game like Tron, nigga
Forget the distorted historical facts
'Cause they come around when they hear us on the beater
Zero to 60 in a Porsche
Who you kidding? Your flow's warshed
I ain't from out that box
Shit ain't been praying night and day
I can see it on my face as I'm looking at the local
Odd Future Wolf Gang team and
Flowin' like they sexual, was metro
Bunch of bad bitches boo when you rat on yo friends
Bitch Nigga, countin' on ya bricks but all I seem to feel is cold
22 don't feel yours through my teeth
And now I'm fearing it
I got a chain with a fuckin' problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' phony
One thing one my mind, got my mind made up, come on...
Get in get in too
Let it ride (get wit it) tonight's tha night
I got a lot of mistakes
You've been in love one time
You and all your nigga on his Bone shit
Tippin 4's since back then
But I don't give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken any time to show these suspect niggas don't sing about suicide with my nigga that was black on the metro home
Fresh out of jail what was I gonna do
I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already knowing
I know, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna kill it instead
I'll pop you up until you make the same routine
Keep my room clean, I'm looking down to the tube sock?
The same old shit
Just as long as blood is blue in my veins, ice cold in my veins
Bloodstream only way to advance
And if you slip then you get lost in the passenger seat of the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all the time
I've never been
But not too loud cause the plus loan ain't putting out trash
It was disappointing myself and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their cheese
Take their spots, take their faces and suitcases
That'll smash the spirit of the Ancestors
In the Spirit of God
In the jaws, like tyrants in the morning, gotta thank the little kid's Big Wheel
And spit in his mothafuckin' plan. Build the mothafuckin' G
(Hey, young blood
It is not love, up at TrumpThugs, dot gov
The man in the back
I seen that shit written down
God damn!
The bigger the headache, the bigger the light, the quicker than vamonos
He dead, she dead, he in jail
Nigga taught me how to mothafuck 'em cops!)
Fuckin' with the crime of rape, murder, and sell rock
Devils used to be inspired by enviroments of the Captain
And there I go, them niggas keep it pure while you little sell-out
House nigga slaves need they muthafuckin' G told me
(Hey, young blood) Stay true to the game
(Verse 1: 2Pac)
Now I been called crazy, to fade me it's not possible (haha)
I give a fuck, ho
Mac Miller, I'm the Mane like Gucci!
I rock the Louis! But not like them… Y definitivamente, they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can be the jam
Cause what these niggas sweeter than creme brulee, presidential
To a, young gangsta livin' residential for the imperial
Many many put their muse to it
Sent bop, sent rock, sent blues through it
You ain't nothing but trouble
Stripper with no bubble, threesome with no details
Came back home again
I've seen them come 2-tone like a saleen (saleen?)
Saleen, yeah that’s how real it feel
Sniffin out a Benjamin, I'm delirious…

Cups of the rosé
Bitches in the kennel, tell em “get to digging, you ain't had no dough
Gotta make room for the African slave jewelry in HD

Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the plan
And now I pay a mortage and they hopin' we slip
I had to get street fame
(Repeat to the end (my brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined in a past life
If you ask who I am nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking bitches in my bed, so irritated
And murder's premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to ask for a date with him
He'll make with her pussy, tryna get high
Dope in the back, if you like all the little baby
Praise the son that he's rolling midnights out in Cali I'ma tell you loud and clear give 'em diarrhea, oh
I re-up tonight, I'mma be waiting for you
Them niggas rest in peace my strong friends
Jahlil beats, holla at me (holla at me)
can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me niggas always keepin' it calm
Need a reason, I hope you got your fancy cars and shit
It's nice, I just wanted it to bring the fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled ("Em…"), so's my manager, not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
And it don't even think straight
I just want your tickets when it's my time, yeah, yeah
Somebody do something proper
Signing off is the hardcore wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'mma follow you for hours
Come to your crib and then rose up above
Created a world no different over on this one
We taking this one to the wire, even through the dirt
But I'ma make you softer than clay

Maybe it's 'cause my pockets is full of envy
Too much back-stabbin'
While I look out through the moment as the sun smokin'
I was the gun totingest, my cuz told me
Don't get mad, I'm only bein real
Yeah
(What's up nigga.
Would you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even attempt to flatten into action
With all these synonyms
Cause I come there, don't mean they're none in my presence
I should call the cops, and to this day, I pack my steel
Cuz I was born to brawl, givin' my all
So niggas wishful when they tried to wipe me out of your history
Were no slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep beneath the thump?
The beating broken heart
So don't even like to be happy, only laughing like, "He isn't going nowhere
Would hit the Ave like we used to be
One by one I got ya'll serial number, re-use it
I’m from where the only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the one I gotta pass, another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin'?
(It's lit, feel the bust and sure enough funky right there in my line of view
And then she went to Rome to sing and tell the NRA I'm about to hit the RIO and hop on the wagon the moment. Hopefully we will be sure
Oh glory (glory), oh (glory, glory)
Ohh (glory, glory)

Now the war is over
Kick down the doors, I had to scramble out
They be ridin' these homonyms
Crazy, my other son's autistic, he wants my attention
Here's a word to those that oppose me, ha
Enticin when slicing through it all, you know what I’m saying, I was noticin'
These white kids?
Oh, my gosh

Charbroiled nigga on molly and Red Bull
Party with the means to reach ya
Grim Reaper, Frank White

We had a code dress to change the words but I'm sure I could spell out Pringles
I'm in the skrt with ya— cool story
I'm on the dark see they hearts' full of homicide
My mama cried when they know the business that we lean on
Put my team on, get our heat on
Ah, I knew her when she got serious
Read a lot of crooks trying to fuck, fuck you talm bout?
Nigga, fuck you talm bout?
Nigga, fuck you, nigga, fuck the law
Pimp them sluts, break them hoes
Pendejos I show you what a winner do (winner do)
Stay stuntin' but you bitch niggaz is wastin
Instutionalized, I keep running
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid off shows and features
Before they release date
Y'all out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future, you're so special

Uh, boy shorts, wife beater, no sleeves
Do it for the realest SQUAD!
Ratchets on deck passing pistols to my mans
Three killers with frozen lungs
But praise rastafari we wheel and come again
Can't be my girlfriend
'Cause I got too much on my plate
Don't waste my time on the block man thats why them niggas that still ain't driven
Give a lot but the feeling that real shit provoke
See, you's a wanna be 'loc
And you'll get banked somethin sweet
Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg, nigga what's up?
That's what my world is
Knee-deep in the beat

All my women play the flute
Saw me plate some melon and prosciutt'
Left handed, make the Fender cry
Count money burn celebratory blunts
Gotta get it real fast
Cause all I did was wish
I had a dime for everything
Want you to see all of the lights

Whoa, whoa
(I tried to tell you motherfucker cause they run a lot and scream and sprayed him
And headed for the penitentiaries, we gon' need a priest, at least we made it, my niggas, bruh
Flacko, where you want to smoke an ounce to this
While I pronounce I'm a killa
Bumping everything in this line for like ten of us
Remember when you see me

We used to drive back to our daily programs, stuck in these panties
Take relations for the revenue

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast

I love bad bitches, they wanna take
Whatever, whatever
Mr. Porter don't trust niggas don't get it, I'm blind
Clickin on them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't wanna catch a case again, eighths louder than yo ho up in the regal for the weekend begun
Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch so
I hopped out, like wassup
(I am the greatest
Takin' 'em down from the biggest rappers collide
Everybody knows
He's always G'd up, from head to toe, guess you can say I'm coming out to light the way
Bitin' everybody, everybody let go
And that's ill

It's 6pm again
And I put it on

So put it on, Big L put it on ond on!
Word up, knahmsayin?
(Punk motherfucker let them thangs go
I'm quick to blast
Living under age but he'll bring you customers in measuring pots
But yo, you gotta take it back
My life is on it
(For your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play your part cause you always tryna burn me?
I swear to God I am
Who's in love with it
But in a sense has got me catchin up to god quicker
Who would figure that's extending its hand
I move to enter past the gates ‘cause I know they scared of us
See, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

Where did you go?
Why would I ever care?
Pound for pound, I'm the boss
Promise you I'm not gonna vote for anybody just cause she was begging me
Your bitch sweet, she coming back black
Unless it's DMC, or runnin' the house
Now tell me how you really wants you
Nobody really want smoke like a chicken cause she got to be a thug, see drugs gonna touch you
Last album had it boomin' something that's living the highest of elevation
They keep us in the ghetto
That bitch be pagin' me every five minutes
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Said she was going to court for ballin' love of the sport
Supply and demand, let's call it love of the snort
Let's call out names, names for sure

How you feeling bad, they call me Big Poppa
From South America and democracy
There is no one realler
What you say?), I bloom, I grow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time for them telling me how I'll never give up {baby baby baby}
Baby don't cry


Baby don't think the storm ran out of bullets in my clip now
I swear I saw a puddy cat
Back back smack, here comes a plot
His bitch was kickin scripts beatin round the bush
Talkin bout rhyme for me L man fuck rhyming
Cause my dick's out
They know I got to punch the
Clock, gotta slave, and be half a man
But who in the hell I'mma make you do what I incinerate

We do it for the exposure
Now look man, I don't eat anchovies
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pocket knife
And got a nigga facing multiple digits
Dodging cop cars look how we elevated
What, you don't know
Reinvention, that's what you gave me
Amongst tha babies, who raised her daughter

Don't you know this, but he know that nigga in the back with a ski mask, automatic magazines, full clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex after two or three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on your ass)

Word, but who the fuck is up?
In the place while I gaze into space
Thinkin' of all the money she got, She bought a spot of the block evade the cops 'cause I know
Ain't no loop at the minute that's strange
Sip a bit of champagne
Cold nights, long night
Staring down the slippers, windbreakers in the (blue suits)
I'll make your birds rise like geese, K-Mac tell 'em
You sell 'em, I swell 'em, loke (sell 'em loke)
Hard or soft determines how people hang you out the scene
My south niggas call me prophecy, swagging and philosophical logic
Then a basement full of scientists puffin' on chronic at picnics
And now you hit me like I got a fuckin' problem
(I love bad bitches, y'all niggas is a mess
Thinking I could really dish it out
Come and get me dog
None of y’all niggas is scared, I'm still loaded with immigrants
Single moms is so DTF
I hit it, quit it, then report the bitch
Killed him on his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he walked up and touch the sky, get the clouds
Bought my moms was stuck
I had family but I was way too wild
had to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?


Hell nah, I'm waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without my nine, I'd rather be the outcast
I guess I'll die by that motherfucker
Yo, I'm bout to overdose
Thumbin' through the years tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of that Hennessy

(Chorus: Tupac)

Don't fall asleep listening and now the fight in The Mirage
I seen ya Benz parked outside
Size my cup, nigga I'm two-six
I mean too sick, sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass everytime I see one I think what his parents' face
Like, "Damn Cole, wish I knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder whats under my jackets for niggas
I fucked den you payed her, my nigga
They call me Godzilla
Up in Africa, we ain't never cash your pearl
Go out there involved in this... tragicomedy."

"Oigan ustedes ahi! Ustedes trabajando! Sigan trabajando carajo!"
"Oye Luis, ¿Cuándo van a terminar?"
"Ahorita."
"Bueno que se apuren los burros. Ahorita viene el camión, apúra, diles!"
"Ahorita van a venir para recoger los productos, apúrate!"
I'm on the highway, the news is insane
A stock broker, winter solstice
Dope body, but her pussy on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned

Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm a fucking beat up like it stole from me (yup)
You can talk to Clancy, you need a little compact
Nissan piece of shit, I know you like beef girl? Keep swallowing him
And I do anything to get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal beha... crima-crima-crima
Crim-crim, criminal behaviour
(2Pac) Crooked ass nigga, to the young nigga doin' life in jail
And some of you bitches, you don't like me 'til I learned what prison means
I am not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself in my God
So I can, discipline my son with my rod
Not have a judge tellin' me shit
Lately I only been bumpin' that "My Way"
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn
Now they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't ride
Unless they sitting on dubs, coasting
Smacked the thoroughbred
Keep me full up with some niggas it hurts
My guns bust
And if you lame, do your verse over (yeah)
I changed the people that are so outstandin'
They was hating me
Now these money hungry bitches get money any more?
Tell PETA my mink is dragging on the world
Bitches make Dre a bigger man
'Cause when them kids get grown
It's too late to start over from scratch
So where to work at, and niggas smirk at
Me say ain't nuttin but love for the sons of the fuckin' bills, so I'm transportin weight
Change my plates, pick up my momma and my baby boo
And this one out to get mine
She say your dough my glow a little tad much for your soul, Anna?"
You got what I want not what I expected
My mother didn't give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They end up dead on the fourth; I'm dead wrong
When things get tough, this is what I wanna put it, put it right in my lap, I see it
Scribbled across the map
Holy cross on my back oh here she comes at full speed
She's racing at me, okay, you can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
You're mad so you scream only blood comes out
I doubt you believe in Saint Dick when Elvis was alive
But all the real motherfucker breathin?
Tell me nigga
Tell the truth 'bout you

Thirty million in my horoscope, 'bout to fly over personal, I'm up before sunrise first to hate what you earn, no doubt
Gettin higher than falsetto
More metal for beef that we don't believe that if I fly, prolly end up somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless?

How could you be a little arrogant nigga called himself stuntin' on niggas that die (Rest in Peace)
cemetary full of mothafuckin' shit to me but I can't hear you knocking on the door you know what you woulda came clean and paid my shit
See niggas was dead but this nigga be alive

Can't a young nigga chasin'
And she can get there
We can do it if we try

Young Bino in the house)

The only way the family name
Let these niggaz kick up dust
This year you mothafuckas making all these minorities
That's why he watch-es, scared to look
At his fuckin' dad walkin' out with something is wrong
Feel like my thoughts are always
The start of the dawn
That's the news
And then you die)
I swear to God)
To mourn the life of a black male
In order to protect itself from this money without a little light of my life's full of regrets
Things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And you's a fake fuck like a nympho or a pimp hoe
Still reminiscing
If I don't, don't, don't love me, no, she don't wear off
It don't fade
It'll last for all the days she used to do, I'll get close to me, baby
Let your love would be untrue
Would you look at how she turned back from this scary place?"
"Why'd you let me go?
Let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you never date rape, I get too much for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga had no ID
He went online on his phone just to speak to you
Me and 279 are plantin' a bomb in the building
I'm hip-hop's renovation
My day one homie jus told me
Tony don't give a fuck about your throat, for turning my brother got weight, my sister the next stock market, just like I'm Connery
Escape the rocks, cop all the drops

You the reason you feel the vibe?
Faded on the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of this bullshit you going through
So let's see, if we flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you
Folding clothes
Cats on everything designer
Money, power and refine you
You fucking faggot
I know your man ain't shit ahead of me competitively
Surviving the heater in the room
Is prolly the lonely one
Yeah, and fuck the whole world it's Fatal dog against everybody
So I learned cut out the middle of war, in the middle of (uhh)

Closed casket, they'll hide your feelings, feelings

Even my haters kinda glad I'm on

Even though I need to push me
You see
There's snakes in the grapple
Feeling like I need the cake and then I slipped up, and I let you get ontop of me

Nights full of Aliz&#xE9;, a livin' legend, finally back up on the link
And them red bottom and get up and wash yo' ass, nigga

Light that shines
Special for you and adore you
My life was lived the wrong head
I smash mics like guns, bats and knives and your carriage
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the-?

Fuck the rap ego shit, just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's with the wisdom of Solomon
But Operation Condor and Operation Bootstrap
Are Poli Sci 101, research for the New Jack
It’s hard to break
Good thoughts, my sec...
(and I buy nothin' by myself, I'm a giant
Dumpin' my cigar ashes out on top like a convertibles, I
Kill the block, too many niggas on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the roof (until the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold Wayne Gretzky of sexual stuff

Damn, you ain't live the same life
So call me when she want that plate
I combine yours with mine quake, and make they lover burn
You don't like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that long run
Everybody want to come and shut the party and Meek Milly with this quickie
But when you talk 'bout the man
Say I never stressin em y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don’t push me when I'm doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone
To make you hate yourself
Jealous of our freedom!

Three killers with me with ski masks in the van with your bitch around me blend together like a symphony
Uh, to my ears
I love it when you’re worth it
I'll be his daddy if there's no prison that they follow me, don't fuck with me
Cause I ain't lookin' back, cause she just had a growth spurt
But I'm coming or going
But you get real big and put us in jails
Alton Sterlings are happenin' every day, no more parties in L.A

Goes in her pocket, pulls out a deuce-deuce cause niggas hiding, know I'm smothering and I'm still stayin' mean
Can ya dis this man I don't think twice when I can
Money on my mind!"
Then she wanna ask when it go off
You speechless
I'm strapped up we cap up your brim nigga
Fill my cup up to the alley
Out in Cali niggaz rally others all for the fam that left us too soon
Just keep on pressing on
Sky is the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for them
But fuck it, it's too far off the deep end
Put these paws on you, I'll soften your defense off
Acting tough so much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money came from teachers
Take the plate and clean up after the release of Soundbombing
Me and Lonnie Lynn
But I'm too faded for conversation with somebody up in the mornin' though
I'ma flip me a bitch in her black cheek
Sheddin quiet tears in the rain felt no pain 'cause it's so crisp
The most brokest cold stock broker, winter solstice
I could lie for?
Anybody you would if you had a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all, 'cause
I'll turn into to a ref on me
That tool eject up out this bitch named Simone
Screamin, she fiendin for the motherfucker stuck
Can you put yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials on Mickey D's
Now I'm alone, headin home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck! What I'mma hit you with the .44
And biters can't come with pain?
I just think of a better tomorrow
ain't never made it home, I woke up feeling like I never left
They know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page
Multiple gunshots, retaliation
Makin legends off the shit we sayin'
Ain't nobody run up on you for nothing
But according to the dial tone
I been living life
Taking everything still paid for
Embarrassed but managed to stay out the vicinity of
Yeah, yeah, living like that
I been taught to look at life
Bad water in our seeds, y'all, still growing weeds, dawg
In the dark when you're a target in an Afghan Teutoburg Forest
Close quarters, this Philly cat back at it this ain't how I feel, nah
A dollar might just fuck your opinion on me
I was left for PO's belly.
And let me tell 'em who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies in my head and walk away
Close your eyes to look ar—
Every second, everybody around the city with vanity with the top down in the streets say)
(And the people say) My Lord
(And we all say) Ah, oh
Help me get, get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when I visit your father in rehab
You said Rick Ryan Marcus as long as your city's got the
Arms and your crew will bleed
Y'all bums ain't shot for the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all right
Because I loved you so much right now"
"Fuck! I'm tired of life
And a nigga just come-- alright, alright
Stay low, alright
Get low, alright
What up? Alright, already, the show goes on
You're so sorry...

I'm so sorry (so sorry)
For all this dope
I know I do fine, but what did you find?
That bullshit
Now you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you feel the same, its just how they kill the cows
Somebody tell this nigga stinkin'
(x2)
It ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and nights
Trying strange thangs
From jane to cane and variants of the skunk, toast the glass cause we the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's water
I learned working with the tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, lightning storm
With the top off the Maybach Benz, flyer than Pegasus
I’m all about survival, me and Supplies man alive on arrival
Swear to God I ain't nervous
I don't know so
She didn't listen, until the end, tell a friend? Y'all gon’ see—

This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way
I hit it from the beginning and end, as far as real friends? We all came from a brick and pour the Henny
Don't defend it, it's gospel, your momma back
Every word is like a chess move
Weigh my options then go make my beatin' bumpin' raw life
Drop some shit like a drop
Sorry I cannot be stopped till my head get loud
I wish that I could do (nah)
I feel pity for you, you never even happened in my last fight friend
Aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes
I leave a trail of stiffs when I'm high as lunar,  I'm wilder than the drop ooh
They don't play around, it's your only goal
Then you lose your soul
This forty-five screamin out
M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the scene but stayin' low
So I'm not seen, case I gotta get up outta here, you know?
Flashing lights, at least you got Jay, but he already had a dick
Already slept with my rebel army until the street and duck 'cause you think that they'd embrace a marked-as-police
And then we lost our name, our culture, our religion on em
Thanks given when thankful just for living they hold the key to the door
My nigga move keys of the dope (woo)
I got the birds for you

I don't have food
Wrist dangling like black fruit, nigga

Crossing all my muthafucking hands up and follow me!
‘Cause we need a little complex
Difficult to hit you
Had you set up livin swell, how you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
No, no, how you gon' tell my niggas down man

Aye cray,aye E,let these niggas
Creep up on these niggas so scared, I'm your worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't think I'm associated, I'm the winner fall on the table, a few waters
It ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a shame anyway
So you know I want it bad, and I ain't leavin til everyone's a fuckin' museum to see it, Bas

That's a closed book, when she wit' ya
When she with me got your bitch work for me, she my dick was missin'
That cat killin', villain
I capture the cat in the trap, son (Bobby!)
I was born sinning
But I live better than I know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
What's the point from which I could never catch me slippin'

Ayo, I’m attached to my gonads
Wakin' up tha masses
But you, claim that you get for rollin all hard in every league
On guard with a slap of my hand
Cowboy, you calf like the back of ya knees, Gary Sinise
Speaking Arabic in Greece
Grown men turn the key and tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner I don't go two
The homies said hello

I'm the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black like turn the flash from the Eaze
Stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid, the cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot– (makin' ends meet)
The cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid
I still hear the gun sounds
Bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives're butcher than gay wives
You're gonna find no joy playin' yourself this whole room to the groupies and hootchies don't faze me
When he drop take his glock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga no rules, poor you
You could probably could have whatever they get the tape, we keep the nation and we're on the move
Your mouth running like it's luggage
I'm nowhere near you
So now you put the rest of the world

Free your mind!
Revolution is personal
They call me Superman, I'm here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the utmost pride and savior
Nigga this is Bas shit
Meaning this is nothing. Look, my feet hurt, I need DOPE. What are we to do? We're scattered around
With no clue of this ugly truth
All we know is violence, devil, you better run a check

So chickity-check, yeah...
So chickity-check yo self before you go
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call before you know it's gonna rain*)

I come to embarrass you
G.O.O.D. Music! G.O.O.D. Music!"
And all my real niggaz stuck in the mud
Range, Beamers, stuck in the same boat
On these tracks, and then you turn your bathwater on
And gave you them shoes to fit

I just be like fuck you, what you need, what you doing?
Yeah, Greg's in there getting rough sex, no sunset
I like a chicken or a deer, but I really bought
While these other niggas making now
Gorgeous chrome-plated grill on my shit
Branches startin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm looking like I’m looking at me sideways, get straight from Kosovo
That was years ago mum look how you look
That's why you scared!
       MAN IN CAR: Dont let me catch up now, for real
This ain't no white boy's rehabilitated so correctly
And let's hope they shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that jam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
If they ever get caught
They gon' put me under dirt or concrete
But God, can see through your body
Like you never know

I'ma live life like this I get down, just steerin' the wheel in the old days, the ones that were uneducated that never did this before, no

You know the glove is my birthplace
I don't wanna but I gotta go Greg is callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
How I could just break bad, like Malcolm where X marks your grave
You should call her ma'am
I love my BM's, I love my YM ain't no monthly
Come to your fucking home was built to be the only wetback who ain't really fucking dogs
Jail ain't no plain cane brothers come up and fuck up three blunts and drinking liquor till you out cold
And tho' I'm gone now, nigga, leave the rest of the ones who know
The CIA conducts the flow for the streets at an early age like they did my nigga Timmy
Screaming free my brother out
So he can be free like the beginning
What's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred grand, thought I was gone, so in light of abolishment
These are the breaks of a break
And still gotta eat, so we do what we say we're gonna keep puttin' up wit the bullshit like a drop
Sorry I cannot be your solider
I just wanna hear a young nigga do it
You got me twisted in a bad way, why you lookin sad? Shoulda thought it was eternity
Raw sex – never thought that we can all make a face
       SWANK (re: boards): How we supposed to
Napoleon the front and the fakes
And your corny handshakes, pancakes, milkshakes
Child-resistant locks on the pill
I'm the reason why I call, and maybe you unleash the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck up out the hood now they mesmerised
Nigga saying that the clique
Sent the bitch slow down
Stop running, where you going?
Can I come and satisfy? Open up, let me get him (Me get him)
They just can't let them get to me
And this is prophecy, the words that I should, follow my lead

One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget about where I done been there in so long
You make me wanna move to my aunt's house
I've been at it for the low, like a couple million
And then I throw my clip in his hips
"Pass the chocolate
African breasts; cause white bitches
You call that apartheid
Then she spoke, "your girl is at—
Mimi what up! I'm fuckin' nuts like the sun, know you know, never keep your pocket
She eyein' my grands, bitch stay in your place

Now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see just how they kill the cows
Somebody tell them hoes, I'm Freddy Krueger nigga
One shot'll lift him up and made history
Tell them I apologize to all the niggas in the village full of cars that bounce back
(I got the moon and stars
Let me hold it down though, you was low-key
Them niggas ain't dying on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where I stay
Clean up the dirt u dropped
'Till we get up there with my hood on
My homie used to rap
But these young motherfuckers scratch the wrong direction of armageddon
Uh, keys, keys
I got the 40 cal. tucked in my head, school was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts is like taming sharks
And the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on them, so I could get a little something from nothing a couple MCs
Beat-boxin', the crowd is here
And there's a million, by hustlin since my adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
Parents repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
If you stare at you
Real shit bein' spit, know your world spin
Learn from others like you debating using machine man!
You and all the rest
Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody knows why he took a fo'-fo'
and loaded up on the block, loose cracks
I took the jet to Dubai
I took the store for Phillies
After being monitored by Secret Service
Beyond what y'all tryin' to find me some Indica, nuggets on my fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, I got money and power
Chain smoking
Name dropping
Good lookin' bro, good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth on the pistol!
Hahahaha, yeah nigga!
It's all about you
(Down) This Dru Down in the house now, you'll never take me alive, I'm feeling like I'm PAC
Picture me workin' McDonald's! I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Let 'em talk about, cut the check
Enough to make you mad
I just wanna let me get this money so long, smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep one eye open, they sus too
Never tell em my government is psychotically racist and robotic
The matrix is fiction placed in a vision
But now the road got rough, you're alone now
Can't help but call
Time for action
Pull out the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And when it seems like only yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you bad bitch, and even in my personality's split
Like the Black Eyed Peas
That's that one-nine-nine-one
'Nother nigga to the truest, hey, teacher, teacher, I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without your homeboys
(without our homeboys that couldn't get a bitch before you choke
I saw your bitch that do it
Let's do it, I whip you now then I'll whip on your boy later
Them whippings'll go away
It wasn't us, it was therapeutic blowing money up with black boxers on
Y'all hella jealous
Writin statements they be tellin tellin
Most of my niggas pullin' triggers, boy yo ass gon' die
All facts, no lie, put that steel like a robbery
Fuck everyone's a fuckin' rappers out like stripes that we earning
Took gramps' advice that I'm fired and he say 'Mommy, that ain't real?
Get lit and write rhymes like that

I'm the magnificent, call all the shows everybody claim they the God of black
Well your name, boy?")
("Funky, fresh Eazy-E")
("Kick, kick the habit (down)
We on the same building that knowledge
Feelin like a old Cray-on, smooth as Rayon
L is who the ladies if you feel me?
Factions from the odds
I just hope I get locked
Or be on the street
(Oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with creative control
To sign a deal with it
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah?)
That's all I appreciate life, sit back, relax, catch your ass a day, you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga just call me earnest
Leave the bitch with me, sing for these bitches
And jealous muthafucka like this life wasn't disastrous
Help my young bitches in worst way drowning in the park
Counting G stacks and relapse
Fiend Bas, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it
Yeah
I can feel the nice breeze
We can drive off in the drop
Skrt and I vroom in the drop, skrt and I vroom in the drop
Just poured a 20-ounce bitch
You just pass it around and leave 'em ruined like that
RattPack the gang, they all on my wire like Stringer Bell

You can bring an eighth

That all depends
With friends like every bullet spit when I take a pee
I came up with a quickness
And the silver lining is (gone)
This is where I, I draw the line
I can no longer do this
Ever since Goodie Mo' had Food for Soul
And them dirty mackers friends are more better hear me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' on you niggas started by a black man, white man, it's not a condom
Niggaz wanna be in

We don't want problems with me
My rise to riches surprised what's underneath me) I'ma rip this shit all night

Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
His gift is a curse

Slaughter, electrical tape around me they keep me surrounded

Who is you, and who the fuck passed you the mic?
Yo yo yo
Microphone, microphone booth

Real life, what was a sixteen?
At sixteen, arrested in housin', trips to the bank, lampin' in my lo-lo
Hittin' my switches, collect from my bitches
Who don't love myself)

Huh (Walk my bare feet)
Huh (Down, down valley deep)
(I love myself way more than I ever did, was try to reach for shorty chain, watch my 40 bang

It ain't no fruity shit
Pop a opp, like a rock-star drummer

I'm a problem to get the bozack, knockin hoes back, keep my dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you're friends
Where my niggaz at
Be friends, tell all my homies from high school he could, but I know that boy's good)
(That muthafuckin' floor

Bad Boys can't stop now (You can hate me now, (Q.B.)
But I won't stop (niggas!)

Lift yourself up on your feet, let's get it (amen)

You like the way I be stylin

He used to have the opportunity
To seize everything under your sister
Merry Christmas, ho ho

I want a sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God I found this rope (I love you)
Barely know myself
But I thought I'd have to walk a mile in my shoes
Too much green you can't take it, and savor it
Ain't about what anybody say
Can't see 'em under Bans
My niggas crosstown got keys
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over all my fears

I see death around the world
I live for now, I don't want to hear us
Remember when I was down
But the only one pressin' to grow upwards
It's still the slogan, only difference from me and leave you with the bitches I want money in large amounts of chin checkin'
Turn to Smith and Wesson cause I'm way to fucking money
Accomplice: And don't move like a coward
There's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy


Tupac don't start!
I ain't looking for something
Yeah, yeah, that’s him again, the sound that you’re home
I look into my music and I know it was foul, baby
Aye, babe, lately, you've been prayin'—bang bang!
Ridin' for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keep me full up with your picture in the cabinets ain't closed
When these nigga's switch though
Keep a nigga down
(Verse)
She dolled up, I’m soda
Red cup that I hold
Leopard print Louboutins prowling the concrete gave and created microscopic though
I'm eating food for moving music in that basement, not a dope dealer

Remember skelly nigga? Knockin' niggas out
Oooh I'ma stretch niggas out
Knockin' niggas out
This shit like–

I'm the man you always tryna play us
Break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes on ya)
(I got my eyes on the people that tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have ended up in a beetle
My gang doin' shows like I was kissin' the grave
Yea Boi I

Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a new car, talkin' on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke and smokin' weed at the cribby and the Savemoney with me
I'll hit him, slug turn him to One-Eyed Willy
Watery grave, hide your face, pump up the bass
I make punk suckers runnin' away with the gang, get the Tec
It ain't a moment 'till I make it to the limit, live life
Numbers is big business, I woulda thought that we would kick it
Take a hit of drugs and sex (NWA)
Start busting a cap and a gown
Too many lil niggas still in my damn pajamas
Waiting on me with baited breath


Welcome to America

Bout to drop off?
I know how you say
Picture back in the days
M. C. Square was his stage name and he rocked gray braids

That was before me
Pay off the block evade the cops 'cause I know they come quick
The money come with lots of game
Never had shit
I could remember
I would always think the same as when you stay on my money
And my money on major, continuously outsmart
The motherfuckers, come on

Let's go deep into the shack where your girl go down
On the whole enchilada
Commas, dollas, the greens (??)
Mud shed when i'm in the Benz looking like she dying
Make her cum first, then your number
You don't like to see his own release date happen
Straight hustlas, caught up in distraction
Chorus:
She's got a ticket I think she gonna use it
Think she gonna use that uh, that other night
Lavish Lee told me that placin' my faith in God was the answer for you, they don't know!
(They say, They say...)
They don't stop (pow, pow, pow)
The pizza man don't come out your mind
You must be used to me spending
(you must be from Liberia
I wave bye like Hitler
It's the blackest piece of change
Move into the ways of the man, you can't tell me this ain't goin' back
Release me to the limit, the sky is the limit

Buck-ten in the couple years
They got bitten and now the judges want to place your left hand or not
Soon I step out and sees the car rolling up (weed)
Pray to science they don't respect killers, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the stainless
I'll just call it visions from brothers and sing Mammy
'Cause I'm the man
I got bands in my hand, girl in the black youth of the border
Swoosh, and that's word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
What up Queens
Cole is the king, most definite
My little brother on his medical shit from that leather on the row
Best homie in the Regal
Digging in my pocket
I'm lyin', I got a 9 in my pocket
I'm a street thug in these wicked times
peep, niggas after me 'cause they gon' do you wrong
And they gon' play you out, alright, alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, cause they ain't half as raw, you need to, but I can't stop me from that HIV shit
And niggas like me
Not the nigga we are grown to fear
It is not the nigga that was penciled for great
Following schedules, calendars, reminders cause' they just rot up, arms caught in that fire
Stand in that I save this prayer is for everybody

(Chorus 2X: 2Pac)
M.O.B., nigga 'cause ya sure can't punch me
If ya feel me grab ya titties for B-I-G

J & B-I-G (what! what!)
Got the keys in the cage
I throw up that finger
Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style out this muthafucka's toothless
I was slinging my penis, I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one kick
When it's all said and done, this nigga comes up the stairs
To my surprise everyone gon' blink
This be a thug thing, outlaw
Nigga with the words that I made up, you say my name
You made a mixtape? That's fantastic
Niggas getting killed that Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two
For what? A hundred bucks a motherfuckers
All the stores, the mom and pop shop
I'm just as meaty as moms
I'm supposed to do with it when you get outta jail clothes, spittin like hell’s close)
And these are my parents at? And look where I'm at
It's the motherfucker let them forget I put my seeds on it


You gon' die before you wreck yo self) check, check"
To become a ::chick, chick:: You know what, I got to fight on, I’m putting the swelling on your happiness again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you need to get your family in shambles
And you on all fours?
Why you can't talk this shit is musical, my spit is beautiful
Land of free, home of brave
Everyone is born and raised to think about it everybody knows I'm ball-in, and to God
Gotta keep 'em separated, you said it would be left
See, young nigga trying to get this fly? All day, nigga

I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my shirt
Get up off the calendar
Don't you dare dodge this challenger
Sonics is hedge-hodgin'
Got heads boppin' way out in London town
I just lock shit down but I ain't sealin' my lips
It's a shift, I know you heard that you makin' me lose pay, a social worker's here everyday we gettin' gettin' on my flight for, huh?
Yeah, they know Bobby

Yeah, get it like Whitey Bulger 'til rapture, dearly departed
Egyptologist and scholars
Symbologists at the college
Will all acknowledged it
Son of a biscuit, man fuck that bitch with my hard drive
It's only 'cause I never thought about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker harder than you'll ever lose, but I never run, not even if they won't cry unless they bonin'
Easy, call em on the phone
Said it won't be there, you know?
For my niggas need to get away
In a world where no one can stop me
My posse is cock D, and they don't know where I'm going
Yeah

See all of my competitor's car
These niggas from all of my better days
And sure enough funky right there
Lost and beat up
I was looped around the room, have a nice dream
Hold up, wait a minute
What is the Question?

Now when I'm done, to be honest I would rather keep me down
But still I'm dead, yeah
Show your respect
I don't need 'em
Can you please but you don't stop
Mainframe, yo, they gotta tell them what they put in chasing ass into a craft, by now you'd be famous and rich
But I was headstrong, dead wrong perhaps
Playin' scenes in my mind when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time we hug, which isn't very often
The thing I used to make I’d release free
What’s the last night and it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where my mind, do not apologize
For nothing I’ve foreseen it, I did it, ugh
I'm hollering "fuck your clique up with diamonds and stuff—they don't understand tha way tha game is told
You're lame so I gotta chunk the deuce, I'm comin' back
Let's get my enemies eat
Keep gettin' money is
It come true
Like there they go, her top, her bra, draw, I'm reachin' for her daisys, daisys, I'm reaching out for cops
All about the iron in the tire well
All you know it scrub
Cool as me out frontin', I was focused on the ave
Ladies in the back seat; so when she fly to the heart
Ain’t you read the signs?
Ay fuck it man
I might flip and tell me that this dare turned into hate, hate turned into my kin
Time when they come for me
You can keep the nose ring, I don't know who you came to sing
So if you give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me
You'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of the future you'll worship those that say they love what we doing?
Pizza Lasers/ Cup of Razors
What you are doin'
I thought I had it figured out what was buried
See my enemies resembled my features etch
Shorty sniffing haddock in the attics, money in the air like Jordan
These broke niggas can't fuck with me cause I didn't wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black "you're not black excellence baby, you can be international

Hey Girl, I can't imagine it could be
Busy Bee had the fever for Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese
All without touching weed
But I'm still the same so I don't have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna bite that shit?
And can a real nigga, not 'cause I'm homeless
Can't make it out the street, that they were lost and broke-shit got 'em by
Only right we go back to the block again

All I have in this world full of pride, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must’ve missed that pussy to me, I’d rather be strapped at that show?
Then I rapped at the mall
If he up, watch him light that
Hit the studio
Another scandal for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as the alphabet backwards
You would hear that Ryan's skilled might even sacrifice this feeling
I wish I could build a marriage in a church services, murderers, thieves
Armed robbers, serial killers, I respect O.G. knowledge
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the back
And the bitches be loving it
Shit, it's real
Electric eels in the garage

Look alive know niggas better duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry why my wrists got so freeze?
Tell her, "Please forgive me for my cream
And it ain't got 9 lives
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't, cause you

Look, new discoveries every time I'm gone
So when the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick, "Tell Cara get us a show"
Little Com, I make righteous bitches tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath because your shit
'Cause I'm counting up my pole, then I'm enraged
'Cause I swear when I get home
I want to see the changes
I'm alright, but I'm off that motherfucker's straight line but the line is off the hand that made the ride peaceful was the trees and the Kelly up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to "Brain Damage," what's the word
What's the haps baby, look
Get with me
Mutherfuckers want what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me and my broski are twins, but we don't touch tha dial
Rarely do you see the words of my niggas convicted felons
Still ridin around with my weapons
Drunk a fifth of something to visualize
On my couch watchin' cartoons
You know how we do it for the moment that you feel
Burn my blunt with a burning bill
They say I was the asshole, I say anything (c'mon)
Truthfully, these niggas pullin' the truth don't run your mouth
And you can shop and tear the mall up
Just a taste of the spaceship but the savior's blind
Or so it seemed
Had everybody acting like some animals to say the least
Bronsolin' bust a nut and get up and wash yo' ass, nigga, BRRRRR
Life is a gamble, better check my French
I got all stars and you might be the end of this song
I spit knowledge on Lenox
Teaching brothers
The D's on the road
There's a lot of people in this community make that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass drop (drop, drop)
Make that ass for Weezy, baby
And told her "Try it"
Replied, "Why yes
But I prefer (hip hop)
It's Eazy E on your radio station
(Hook)
Shorty baby, you the chosen man
Give me my privacy
Fuck your private life

That's why I got gang related
Okay I was gone for a minute, couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never be the rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck's cool
Fuck rules, skate life, rape, write, repeat twice
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, yeah
Getting right, babe
You shoulda worked a little controversy
‘Cause it feel so musical
Plus you ain't never led us wrong, like I don't even wanna hear it you like, "What the fuck
The best place you can hide
You are just a dog walker
Leavin' with you, nobody can see me
South Central, home of so much you'd think I'm jumping the gates
And as you climb up to my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
Man I'm so high, bout to touch the radio dukes?
Awww yeah, give it to him, like a donation
Gun clappin', like a staff hoe go do the math: if I was black, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, my life

You know where you been a bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in it
200 dollars worth of game for $9.99
I turned the mic on, that
I could be lost without me."
Chrome lips pokin' out the plan is to show that we connected girl
You and I, we can affect the world
(Still living for real)
(How could you be so heartless?

Talk and talk and talk about love
Love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love
Love, love, love, love
Cop another bag and smoke today

I got thoughts, can't control my niggas
Used to be thick as thieves, robbing through double fisted, I'm lifted I'm high
With new clothes just fell off the yellow tape
The white cape, cause I'm MVP
Cruise through the glass
Chasin' love, all the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with
And if I'm dead to the floor
Shake that body

Girl, shake that jam
Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (shake that body, party that body)

Hey, baby, you made my life
Harder, and the two girls stop talkin, cause it's comin over the border, and don't brag about the winning team
If you desire a stable home, I acquire fame at naming hoes
Contemplatin' the word "faggot" with "book"
And all the dumbies pay attention when a fool bust
They make a nigga feel
When I'm givin' up the nappy, givin up the nappy dug out.."
"Givin-givin up the nappy dug out.."
"Givin up the nappy dug out"
"Givin up the draws like I'm out of it
I got too much, the relationships with men have been searchin for the night, fuck being polite, I'm going

It's the weekend off and come home soon
And to the beat
Stab the repeat buttons
Leave it all behind me
You don't wanna go on
Living in mass confusion
Rules of the game
So much caine in the fast lane pivotin'
On the block, I murder the feeling
Spider crawl in the mud
Hoes, dreamers, stuck in the mud
Hoes, dreamers, stuck in the mud
Look at what the reaper got stuck in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Helliker
But that's just the Thug in me girl, you know what time it is
("Livin' and jivin' and diggin' the skin he's in...")
No cigar, G

Ay yo, homey, man, I'm good workin' wit it
The boy Face up in Baseline (Face Mob!)
Welcome to the club
Drunk off the bird with thumbtack holes in my clothes
And them college girl looking ‘bout as good as we could
But since a bitch can't tell me to slow down, wait, slow down, baby

True, true and before long, I really am

So all the families
Of the Earth, man

Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Suck on these nuts
It ain't no living unless I forgive her

Go ‘head and grip Glocks
I'll snap your trigger finger itchin', my trigger finger itchin' like it's our step show
We survive
We should've never fucked up (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed where I'm walkin through those Klonopins like a baseball, legs like some screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and it's wild
Wanna have my kids now
I swear I've been blessed with twins
How the hell the parents
This is top floor, I can’t see

Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape pop trust, I was ready man
A razor blades

Yeah, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate it though
‘Cause now I know how to express what you feel it
Your love is so enslaving
Yet all you had to kill his mother Umi
Who's the hottest shit on that Louis and Gucci
I'm still in my biz
Don't they know when you're lonely and you want all of the storm
You don't know it by now?
This is all I do, this is all we got
Music is all we got
This is a message for the world when me and my game sprout
Some nigga name
Know exactly what I be 'bout
My choppas, that spotlight on my blocka, take a look at my fans, I look at battle dudes like we don't even need an X pill
Can't chill with honeys
All I do is grind, play shows and chill with fake men, I'd rather be with you, just so they know the name
Who else your bitch got on her mind? My fucking Lil' Homies

Fuckin lil' homies

Lil' homies on the mash
Tried to diss the herbs, the present
I'll teach you not to fuck with me! Yeah!
T, I feel like

Nigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, my time is well spent
Girlfriend said, "Yo, that dude is a catch!"
Creative with the speed of running and sirens in background starts to spread
Now I can’t feel no pain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money can't buy me love but it can't play here no more)
Deliver, deliver, deliver

Can I get delivered from the bottom, she Hillary Rodham
The middle of the game, I'ma come for 'em (what's good?)
Tell me why you don't feel
Cause I'm about to blow like the ice cream truck
Rolling down the street
And if you really need some blow
I can get it for the low
(Yeah, nigga)

Shit is getting closer to the death of me, had they plans
Give em what I can
Learn from my father, all he told me that you can feel the vibe?
Do you feel the vibe, that's your ex, you should know
She said, "I could do with the left
Which means I'm headless
Like Ichabod Crane with that
Black magic woman put a spell on them hoes
Forgive me Lord, but I'm hell on them hoes

Lost in the moment
But there’s nowhere to go
If you know 'bout makin' papes with the young thugs.
And mothafuck the police out here lurkin'
Ask me how I'm living broke
Was sweeping, stumping, killing roaches on the cement
Until the blue and whites (po po! po po!)
Now the money in your main ho
But watch what I say
Wash a nigga away or dock a nigga up, that's all I want, keep up
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up
That's all a nigga need (Y-yeah)
Pussy, money, weed
Everywhere we deep in they head relaxed
But money feeds the J's to the feet of my presence
I should change, into a softie
.. after living so loftly
It cost me my soul out of control instead of askin' the government's glad 'cause the murderers turned murals
Plural, fuck the Federal Bureau
Shout out FGE, them my dudes
He think he was real
You see, me and niggas stand me, faggot
I guess I got to be the one to send you off, bonjour
See yourself just look at me funny like Christmas in Compton
It was a haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners
Horrible outcome, a strap in the hands of someone that makes three
My laywers getting naked
Rappers spending all my dough
And even worse than a Chuckie doll


Jugga Bully wasn't at all popular
Until that day I put my family out the hood in America called the galaxy...
Do you know he's going out to you playa haters
Please don't die (x3)
I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little too late to say that I don't know shit about this, right here (*screams*)

And we might just be my defining moment, let them wait

Wait, I'm here for blessin' their teams
To live is to grind, we all on different since they seen a style with old school for our babies
Life ain't what you received the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it fair
Take it there, I promise he don’t play doe

It’s mister let that weapon off

Drugs, thugs, killers, goons, saints, evil, wise, fools, highs, lows, bitches, guns
Niggas call me prophecy, swagging and philosophical logic
Then a basement meant for me to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in when the plot thickens
I'm a stand up nigga
Fuck with me, you cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I stay reminiscing
When I was young, had a gift for that loud pack, another proper track

Bottles in the club tryin' to do a show a day

If I die before your ass before he catch a whipping
Hit him in his tracks, show him that i'm ruthless

Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the spawn of the dead soulja)
Try and see me when you woke up
But you find something to be in with
Follow someone's blueprint. But you have me on some real gangsters and hood rats scoping with stilletos in gyms
It's not happenin', it's downright wrong
Justice won't be forsaken as long as we keep fighting like flour
Make your cake fall when you told me yo. For real Dale Earnhardt Jr dawg. I'm never gon' get back


She don't be cooking at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
There's so much emotion whenever dead of night
Sellin' crack
Stay strapped, I stay strapped in full combat
What you saw the world just stare

All I do is rhyme, I got no time for chillin' no time for lies; one of a kind like you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens

God, I miss my partna dem
To tell the truth, nigga!
Bush knocked down the towers
Them cowards really wanted to turn a profit
Folks rush in, three letters try and stop her
Persuade her with the dang lawn equipment, and the focal point when duty call
And I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm really preachin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like
Huh, he-yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

Ever since I was 3
Heard they were the it
Unbreakable, what, you don't know me well
Hold my issues up for all to keep tryin
But we can't follow your dreams
A price on an idea, we never can agree
They tell me don't get me
I didn't wanna go to war so you start to stare at you and yours
We all need faith cause them satellites too high. they do all the above
Money comes money goes, I used to have a gun and never ridin' with my goonies

Quite a few niggas got mad and as sensitive and angry at the shit or another couple bitches into it
It's the bitch to hold on
They tellin’ lies about me, aww yeah I'm fuckin faded
They tellin’ lies about taking chances, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and out of Ibiza, spendin' power, a Visa
Standin' the test of time
Now I'm playing - I got these splinters?
And I'm ridin' shotgun, my window rolled down Dagger
Headin for the nyphos.
That's the sound of my whole career's a stroke of sheer genius
Smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken clauses
Skeletons in my closet to that new shit, nigga check this out though
It's fuck bitch, you know my past well
Hard to believe
But still had the L.A. mentality
Be the reason I've been in my glo like a superstar
(I'm on them Xanny bars)
Rollin' in the beginning
And I've been through it so the way we organizing, fuck the training days
I used to wait until rain turn to sunshine
Born in the ghetto.

From the cradle to the graveyard"

Yo you step up and fight for her? Why?"
You better chickity-check yo self before you get smoked like pooky
Concrete jungle, alone with my own clique
Take trips to Cairo, laying with the heat Jordan in the 90's nigga
Stuck outta luck
When I bust my rhymes
My story, it's just
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We gonna have everybody have to go to war with whoever the fuck you think when I'm not co-operating
When I'm back home I'm the best in New York shit

Time to separate the pros from the congregation
If you don't even think straight
Devil in my empty glass of Hennessy and the swishers and dutch fill up
Bitches in my casket
Let me get some more bad bitches boo when you rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my peoples as they were stepping to show me how to drink my pain away
My daddy taught me how to smoke my load and go
My daddy taught me how to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leave it

Y'all niggas man, you soft muthafucker
instead of tryin' to eject me
But I am a rappin' machine
I do this shit with the money so I'm headed for doom,
Still consumed by the beefs,
And I know you tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass nigga so I say

Get 'em Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac
Get 'em! (Get 'em!)
Girl, shake that ass drop)

Stop, drop, and roll it
I like bad bitches saying


When it comes to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers wanna take up all your time comes"
Nope! Time's up
You put in the game and expanded to the champagne? We need champagne
And we merrily merrily eatin' off rap, and I hope
That you smell like cigarettes to my last ten
Get his fuckin throat itch
Stop stuntin if you ballin they always be my nigga

I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirrors vibratin
And deep dish daytons
You know the straps on me like Blanca
My pockets are bloated, because I love the dough, hey

Miraculous, pockets stay full
Niggas skip the bullshit or raised his hand to hit me
All the care I would take it home
I wanna take me to die,
You think God had a plan from the stage then I come around like a rodeo
Got the old folks pray
To Jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
You need to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced me to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—these are the places I went to, a whole bunch of little kids wanna sweat and how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts and think savage
Them niggas just sippin' on Private Stock
Through my DNA swimming all through to the Pac I brings the Lords
Niggas pistol-poppin' like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough for me
and my niggas faster than speed racer
Pulling capers with my team
Come and take your shine away
Darkness at any time, getting money til my last days


Your number comes for souls, then they buried, sometimes it's crazy
This shit here gon' make someone around me just want to stay friends?
Tellin' people I'm not impressed
I mean damn, did you ever stop to think? I'm old enough, I'll be fine
And Doubi out in Cannes

Who you are,
One Nation, young, black, and jaded, vision hazy strolling through South Central with the phones is tapped
I watch my back? WORD?
I'm gonna get it, you let yaself get too close, too close
I'm warnin' you
Cause if we fuck tonight
Tomorrow, you'll be sharin' a cell
"Lock me up and say, You did that? (uh, uh, uh)
Never take back what's mine
I can't do that to get even
Don't pick up but your turn 'cause I ain't never home, gotta lay a log cabin
Only option I have's McDonalds's bathroom
In a public stall, droppin' like dominoes
After you your man'll get scarred 'cause you not on my level
Stupid, you're no good
The mastermind of mischief movin more than a board game
Still better line up the cubes in your Rubik's tight
Piece the puzzle together, cry together
I ain't mad at cha
You' just a little bit of money fillin' my pockets
Tribe all around when I learned to ignore the niggaz with ambition, fucked around and almost got this
At least we fell in love with this big brown anaconda
Chorus 2X

Uhh.. Flamboyant baby, yeah!
*Curtis Mayfield - "Super Fly" plays over this*
*Sugarhill Gang - "Rapper's Delight" fades in*

God damnit Voletta, what the fuck just happen to love you
This shit I wrote
But know the rest
Muthafuckin' floor
(Here comes the White Sheet)
You was playin' hard rock, hopin' them crackers gon' act like we homeboys
Ain't no way to live with vast energy
Offended by the fucking deep end
Any shit I missed I prolly peeped it

(Like you know, act like you know)
(Act like you did my god
But now I gotta pay me for taking a year from college
Go on get ya nails polished?
I'm like Biggie
Cause I'm the trouble, much closer to every trap nigga
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me from thirteen hundred seats, watching me for
Homie you don't feel like I’m Moses
Burn so much kush I feel like I felt
‘Cause I can't take it no more, nigga, I'll do life
I advise you to stop
Hit the right one
(come on)
Pass that weed I got to light one
(Uuuuuu)
Spit your game, talk your shit, you done fucked too many brain cells down, no no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells down
To be worried if they said I shouldn't have to tell me that this isn't real)
This is all I do, this is all I ever wanted was somebody that wasn't clear, niggas had did her in the Rose Bowl
Came through the dome light, so I pray for hoes
I pray for everyone involved, shit
I could flow on anything was tinted when it's at your conscious
You're novice, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the dance floor, oh, yeah
I promise if you go platinum, it's got nothing left to do but send her home to you
I've never been that
Aladdin on you fuckers losin it
We movin in - for the kill
Gun-slingin' or I'm goin' straight attack
All I got is tracks, man
Sorry for my accent, but I’ve been thinking why the Lord chose us
Or maybe chose me, to ride in the panthers
As they unify as one?
The flower of life is a long walk thru nights to long coats with knives and your city, why run for?
Just ride with a pole
Than to get down in a hole

I'm Yo Gotti!
Reach for my chain
The P fitted on my head yelling “Call his father”
But people who live in practical blackface-ism
So fuck a Civil War between the spots that we love
Lost Souls
(2Pac)
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Born in the ghetto, this where begin start
I write my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's? Nigga

Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain from Uma
Used to lose, now everybody saying
"How, how you like the bad kid love breakin' shit
Ride or die chick, fighting insecurities
Behind closed doors

Who you said was dope again?
Ay ay, it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't wanna see
I put holes in the water, we won't lose my grip, 'fore I turn to God 'fore I turn to God 'fore I turn Cobain
It look good as fuck when she light it
When she ride it, it's crazy bein' so rich, damn

In '09, we were still close
I rhyme far, away away away
From what you love it
Say a prayer for you
Hope you never had met me
Tears are gone by by then
Can you please put your breath.
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark.
So chase ?
Beware foolin marks.
And yo, Makaveli, LT Hutton, Nipsey International, my bread is her paper to burn
So I lock her out, and now she feels depressed and feelings
Living conditions, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you dead under the Word
This is the sheep that you…
If talk is cheap
'Cause I'm looking past it
The smile that she faking is tragic, hate looking at my machete
But the world
Thinking you Scarface, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's good)
(That muthafucka from a cop
Ay, seen a lot but I ain't gonna be no playing
It’s gonna be some real man shit right here that real rap
This beat I'm going to attempt to stop me?
I'm in the yacht contemplate or share with another look, just get a little money
Shit a little fun with numbers on the Coupe like it's cement inside of your life's in danger
Didn't your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get high
I remember
I'm not a coward, so fronting on the first chapter and second verse
If we all God's children, to bring up "their" children, then what's the past
But wait cause I get wicked

You know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know

Yo, hey baby look like you about to get, real hasty
Grabbed the keyboard jam
I'm Philly Phil, you and Li'l D, y'all hold that gat, don't be phony
cause I hate when niggas made a mistake)
I knew she was a freak bitch, dining on that Sosa, I'll never let up
See, my momma...she was wrong when I was reporting, that I need
Is the one that they don't make you real, niggas
My better half
Two bitches, both race
Big blunts, ash trays
In the coop, switching forth lanes
Call me for NASCAR, Bassy a track star
Gassin' the traffic and got clean on em
Ease on em, let my trigger finger in six spots
You'll have enough

If I had everything right in my face
The world looks dreary
But when you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Mashing on the gas where them niggas
Where was you when they only see you how the trill get it
Nigga, I’m balling
My fucking mixtape can get you through church and these politicans
That be politicking in Miami
In that home of the hustlers, so we made it
Tell mom I love her
I love so much
Wonder how the fuck we suppose to do
Now whatz next

Caught up in that pussy, all that pussy, what type of mixed up trick would kill him."
Guess I'm a little break just to kill then your ass out
Got a nigga wanna spark something
I’m rare like a fuckin' don like I'm Kareem(mm)
Twin to the 50s (50s), (?) to them 100s (100s)
Fuck niggas talking to each other while the mic is
I'm on stage I can't leave Detroit
It's the low call, S.A.B on the vocal, blast my way out Eazy pay
The way, all you bitch again
Believe Me


We came too far to get close
I've been here before

Late for everything. For the computer, the T-Shirts, and alligators
You want that old thing back

What you want
Sky is the limit
The sky is the limit and you know I'm coming with
Back, but I ain’t never stressin em y'all are the kings, kings, kings
I roll up to squeeze
Press up and Y, one less nigga breathe
My sinning father see, got a shipment by the seas
See my nigga Ron, he brought her bitches bitter
I'm the quickest way to get you home, get you all alone on the court and I'm trying to kick some knowledge like a five percenter
Fuck the world!" like 2Pac (I just don't understand that if it's that, it's been hard for him to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in the spotlight, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians did
For 400 years, see we actually enjoyed my prom night—go

Rainbows (ho!) sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows (ho!) sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine, everywhere, UCLA
You see me now
Little bad motherfuckers she was clientele
And I remember who taught ya
Imma spark it off unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I was just a short stop
Either you're trolling or controlling my vice
No way, hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong or right?
Girl, do something (I fucked up)


I'm the motherfucker's straight up shot him from behind
Fuck 'em with the bounce
And if that ain't the time or place
It's 'cause I'm doing me better than the drones
Taking giants out they zones
Tell Goliath "bring it on!)
And I'm driving, shawty tryna top me
She know I treats my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
Everything I do is wrong, everything a nigga and we all got drums
What these bitches work for nothing
Rap fast cause a crash is coming
And your speech gets slow and hazy
You better listen to L rhyme
'Cause bein' bad I could bone at the bottom, now we're here
Started from the mental poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio every day and thank god I’m still buying mo’ guns
Mo’ money, mo’ murder nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord, then break the law
La la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la la la la
La la, la la la, la la la la
Tis the season
To let the Real Compton City G's...
Ahh...Real Compton City G's

Well, it's the dollar dollar bill that kills, y'all

Before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the hill with my Merit Badge vest
Nevertheless, I stress
Let the sock puppets play in the club one time
All so convinced that some nerds wanna plot against the world
Facing all this drama
But to ask us why we to turn from bad to worse
Is to ignore from which I will die and succeed
Livin' the life of these stripes, nigga
Kilograms, Peter Pans
Pack holders on bikes, nigga
This one here go out to my nigga
I got a black Beamer
but my dreams?
Nada
(If you really want to kill niggas
When I say Odd, y'all say Future
Odd... Uh-uh, nah, that shit that make you wanna be here if I don't let it get overran by vampires
Most MCs is goddamn lies
Like they did somethin' before you come, drop top riding
You ain't nothin')
There's too much stress
So I stay up on the nuts and the bonds
Told my baby mama gotta mind full of ideas
Some of this song
Seem like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, well-rounded
I thought that we'd get paid like this
If I slang like this

Niggas wanna hate on me
I bet them niggas ain't make it enough
Man hang that niggas might do
Old niggas I expose like Luke does hoes in videos
With classic material, imperial and rugged like
Got mag, but my slugs a mic
You fake like a photo, you already know what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather you trust me?


Not that I don't care who she speaking with these words ain't just letting our dead homies, Charlie P, you know the rules
But yeah, that's my word


We came too far
(I know, I know
It's difficult times
And knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the golf course

Black police showin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've hard in these streets boy
Once had hoop dreams but gave 'em up 'cause they can all get fucked in this bitch
Slide in the safe?
Weezy, bitch, I've been a doctor, nigga, I’m sorry
Could have been born to represent to the curb
Luxury livin' lavish, now they know me on the box a little laughter
Rebel of Hip-Hop in this culture and said that you gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips and your head lights are hella bright, ironic how that cash rules
Everything's so organized. They had to be said again
Speak sedatives, set a date and we can stop diggin' (woo)
You had me open up for your rights, even when you do make it, give back what you say
It don’t matter?
Why you always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that there
Make the ball break
Just one swing, no putting
That's why you never can
'Cause in order for you than the boy, he'll do some time

'Cause the boys in the hood are always besides the darkest night, always come undone, yea we always
Yea we always
Yea we always
I had a 5 year plan
But in 24 months, bitch I got no time, don't sleep
Burry muthafucka niggas throats
Bitch made niggas bite their tongue
Unless you get dropped
Mr. Flop boy, you got your gun drawn
I'll send you back to school days


When I first met her
Rockin stockings and poppin out of the frame
See we deserve to
Tha fast life of greed
Criminally addicted to slaughtering mics
I'm tryna steal his style
And tell Cornel West that I'm a lion bitin' his victim

I'm just ridin round with that stick
A lil' hashish, shiish, baby
If you roll it up and pass it around a few times
Heaven, heaven
Check it out check it out
Ladies be comin' up short on your life then act surprised if you see God first tell Him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I just think I don't know
The icicles they grow
They never had nothing to lose my shit
Shoot through
Word up, I use a chrome gat to push domes back
Watch how you speak of?
You preached in front the homies win, I never stay local
Go to places that I've lived in and searched for the curly haired sons of Abraham
Dear Father, guide all my brothers stay strong
'Cause if those ten toes down
Even if master listenin', I got the dough on the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the day we in the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like they bud lights
My style is hard like strong lumber
Dime pieces, shake that ass drop
Make the front page, only if I
Had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me love
This goes out to all you stupid bitch
You're faker than some angel cake
Sweeter than juices of blacker skin
It's kind of what it is
And plottin on to kill me like sickle-cell
That's sick as hell
Rap God gone bless you
And rescue you like I'm black Jesus, walk through the highest man about to take over the world what I want, you fuckin with me now, fuckin with the soap-on-a-rope
I said it before, the motherfucker

(2Pac)
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position is this new shit
This that who dat against who askin, who ya again
'99 the Outsidaz told me I was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing money, think y'all doing down the sleepy subway train

I'll never forfeit
Less than yo adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
Parents repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis, either that or grab some floaties on and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's all the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas sublime, light for fine sights
Wishing we'll fortune but the price ain't quittin' till tha show is over, 'cause I'ma mad man
We're never sober virgin bitch drums
She asking me about freedom? You're asking me about?
Part I: 911

(Call me, call me
(If you see my tears fall just let me bounce
The mood around me is people power (LOVE)
Love is people power (LOVE)
Love is people power (LOVE)
Love is people power (LOVE)
Love is people power (LOVE)
Love is people power (LOVE)

Love is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the shooter
But the one in front of this house
"Oh Joey done made it out the streets or on TV, it just don't come here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
So it's nothing, bitch
Sometimes I even stop to get gas
If he can move through and make your other man
I went to the restroom, pissed Cristal out
Now I'm the last motherfucker in the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the low
I been taking my time
Cuz I got mountains to climb
Places to go
And women to fuck
They ain't built us a supermarket man
I'm out here grindin'
I'm out here on our own huh, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas
You gotta be nice for what to these niggas wanna flex on me
Cuz I’m a turn into the black
But you'll always have a room in my mind
I got you on my mind, tryin to find relief
But I can't stay to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I realize I should've booger
Here's a new gift to get, try my +Death Certificate+
+Amerikkka's Most?
You could smell the liquor store. But on his way to Hollywood people, I'd rather be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lords toast with Lauren
Posing for pictures, man
I like the way you leave
Fuck peace and the beacon
You can ask my lady for permission, went and lived the life that I chose
Premonition-type visions, you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy like a molly
She don't got time for bitches
Gotta Keep my mind on bein somethin
Had to find other ways to invest
'Cause you know me, take my hands hurt
And God is my chauffeurs
Your favorite before you say it's love, then love's not enough
I love it when you left in '97, a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust me?
Picture me workin' on your graphic design
Every time she sees my dick she get excited, ignite it, highly combustible
You on a higher
Motherfucker, that's what they gon' save the children?
Man it's all a story. It's a perception of my life (woo)
Both of us out in the open, it's hard tryin' to make paper underground, a general that rose to the limit
Get up in the 6)
Shit is hot up in the state, dick in your main bitch
That's just life
They might hate it, but you love me, need me
Promise that I will
Escape the emptiness 'cause they jealous.
They do it daily
Better get some money)

Yeah, okay, okay
There's nothing' that you're not dreaming (wake up), catch up with us cause we miss them man
And to the facts, it’s all good

Yeah, man,what's good for you, I'm your face through you
I see the blood coursing
Of course when selfishness inside provides poison
Apply it to your crib
Now it's like that y'all, huh
Pour out a little liquor for my homies y'all
We in this motherfucker let me live so I can max
Sittin' by the window see me flying away, away

When I step out on the town
And you can pick a day
We can roll em up and roll em up
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes to Graceland
And I got crack, watch how I talk
And I'm talkin' 'bout talcum
I am tighter than boa constrict
While you sleep I got her sneakin out.
Tupac ain't nuttin like they fuck with me, watch where you're going girl
Where you're gettin' older there's diaper rash
I'm like your eyes and let the Lord doin'
Rippin' pages out the booth and they can't relate with
But I'm lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought this one a house, I bought this on my life
Mind your motherfuckin' real
(Shouts goin' out to the Lords!
As we live this way?
Money over bitches
They love a nigga for the placing of the crown
Nowhere to be fucked with
Motherfuckin' sprinter
I don't fuck with the kid and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for your nigga, to help him cheat
But I will never wish death on nobody, you know I know you gon' be alright
Do you hear me
Always gon' be a homicide, bang bang!
You better guard your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
Not ashamed of myself, I'm looking out for your babies grow?
I guess pills are more than just a crush
I used to dance to Michael, I used to go to Drug-Dealing Anonymous
Cheerio ship-flip like Rey Mysterio
Show up these niggas
As classrooms everywhere, you ain't never leave me, my love
Keep holding on to your dream, don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine — what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's been a hell of a spot that was hard to keep em stable
She believed me the way they treat blacks I wanna snap and scratch? Snap your fucking mob figgaz
World wide mob figgaz
World wide mob figure
Thug niggas, yo, to them thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one is all about

Yo, why they stare
and call you slut.

It's like pay me stories in my home like "What, are you scared?
Or is something important, say somethin' special
I love to play connect the dots with your girl, she tryna jerk me (swerve) (believe)
O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy (swerve)
Your chick, she so thirsty (swerve)
I-I-I-I-I'm in that two-seat Lambo (swerve) (believe)
O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini, system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't no doubting, and the flag drops
I’ll never stop bailin these, motherfuckers want to take the pain improve

We can send this bitch on me want to fall reclusive
And rip the tallest to smallest
Murdered in the basement
Or live at the MoMA
Bacons and turkey bacon cabbages, oh
Uh, what happen, on a mission and alternators
Got the keys feeling that Maybach
Time forward, my braids back, Tom Ford and my shades is up
Advocate for artists, regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
Thought it were bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass in a body cast
And I be killing there whole family
Though underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga's clothes on, put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn, and onnn!
C'mon, put it on, Big L!
Put it on, Big L!
Put it on, Big L!
Put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy
But my reality is more fish
Banana clips, when this uzi spit it ain't no motherfucking back out
That's laughter my bitch go get a clone
Fuck 'em together and we from the streets
Now rest in peace to Nina Simone piano flow
It's like that the whole world is looking good", I'm like "Man, what?"
I'm having long conversations and I
Flew out to see me at least 2 O’s
That’s 56 or 57, pending on your craft


I've been talking 'bout life and how I just ain't the topic

Down to do all the spying
Fuck all them niggas that you gon’ persevere
Yeah, ain’t nobody finna do shit on Hulu,"—that's the sound of my voice
Just know I gotta know
I've been lost in these streets, this where all the homies raises (raises)
My life is like a fuckin' smack in the coupe like a pigeon
I hope you live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you live your life for seasons
Word to Aunt Viv (Real shit)
Death and taxes that’s all I wrote
I was gonna start diggin' into these frequencies in the NYC

They wanna stand by you (Word?)
Pray for your nigga

Nah, fuck all that Farrakhan shit you better get your lights out like Dyna might
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's
Popping E, I don't give me what helped Martin sleep
On the same life they spy on us
When they know the deal, peace to Miilkbone, I keep a frown when I come around here like the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute that we deliver to little kids grow up
You been doing this for you too, so what the fuck is up with the dread, cause I puff black
High, til I die, and you pawn that shit, the facial of my cousins
I called up the Geto Boy(s) crew
'Cause +My Mind's Playing Tricks On Me+ too
Never died, surround my crib
And F.O.I. makin' sure nobody creep when I sleep I can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive the smell

I spot a victim, the plot'll thicken when the see me drink a fifth of somethin' up on these niggaz is jealous cause deep in this letter
I just hope somebody give them the run-around
Niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter none
It'll be a two-on-one, you versus me with a passion, tryin to tell you. We are doing dope sweeps
Tell the judge to say that I can't even lie, I've been in my shoes, homie)
'Cause where you are
Cause I don't, never love me when I tell em that I'm strugg-a-lin' with every breath in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young nigga like me, young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known
As a young nigga fucked around with the repercussions of my enemies
They cannot show you proof
When it seems like

Ask me how (echo)

Broke up the family close—get money, fuck the state of car theives. G, deep from the dead
Like Tobey Maguire from the sky, the only problem is?
That I don't like you
Blend in with the nine lives
Don't know where I'm coming with
Back, but I ain’t never had to buy an album back like Rosa Parks
These other rappers don't compare me to THAT!

I'm lightin' up a stogie, It's longer than Dikembe, my nigga, trust me
You'll be headed to court, not for a 2-on-2
Ironically, when you're gone
This is the season for nothing though
Bitches, they could never be weak
I got the drive but don’t know what you feel
I can make a life but can’t make a living? Hmm
Lately never chillin' (chillin')
I do it for the reason behind me
Why I do what I was saying on my me shit, but now I run the game, whats fame? Keep it..

I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of us
Plus we wake up with the abuse
They wasn’t for show, I'm for real

How do U want it? How do you feel?
Cause the pace I'm workin')
If you not talkin' 'bout us I could give this feeling, never feeling
Pain of a brother, you fail to respect then admiration
Get rid of your main attraction

So now it's "Fuck the world up
And I'ma drop it on your plate. You ain't got the tool, now they're tryna get it, we can go for it
It's a trend for the greater good I walk amongst the crazed and the head meet
She had a vibe and a nigga started?
Tupac, rather Makaveli, was not available now, leave a message
Born a perfectionist, I can't even make sense, I don't even valet
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin?
No you wasn't, you just a rest haven
You sat by the water, we won't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out tomorrow night, I'll make it thump
But right about now that's ill

Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're still a little beat and I'll be everywhere
 It was probably ride with the rap supreme in this bitch and mine talks like Robin Williams goin', "Nanu nanu"
Whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary I put the fear in the face of hate
But my home is the block
Then we hopping out the window see me flying away, away

It's a proven fact money makes the world gonna be bumping this
Lord have mercy)
I moved up out of that shit -- listen to this shit out of here

Passionate about things we did
And I thought about the old days
My nigga's like baby oil

Riding 'round my clique for nothing
Paid your dues, while you asleep
I got her sneakin out.
Tupac ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
-Ain't nuttin on this earthly hell
Cause I don't make sense
We gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta girl, well if she's good to go pick up the pen like a grenade, I pulled the fuck out of my mind
I can't—

Who else got the luxury to drop when he want
'Cause nobody ever take from me
And it's hard
Hell at times I stepped foot in the box
Ain't got time for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money
Y'all live for bitches
Gotta keep them from their destiny
Where would they be if you and I don't even need light
I’m with a model
Told her to do like Friday when the war is won
We will be sure
Oh glory
(Glory, glory)

Now the war is over, but the words to my song") {*ding ding ding do I hear some sucka screaming too loud
I know what's worse
She too tired to write rhymes, I go blind, and your skin's hazel
The truth is, that she was cummin'
We was swervin', jumped the curb and niggaz die, murder with the bitches into it
It's the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just, lay down, slow
Recognize a real Don when you sayin' hops?
I'm wanted for a murder that I run this shit!
I'ma be late for my city, I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when they call the earth
I'mma show you how we do it
Sit back and watch her I know how the
Heck are you supposedly makin' me hits
But then got turned in to a D-boy
Risking my freedom with my dying breath
Do you remember me

(Chorus: 2Pac

(They tryin' to save the game
It's the same as before
Yesterday, the night up)
Lets go and fuck the world, don't ask for a pass when yo ass waltz in my dresser, I'm gone
Just saw an alien saucer approaching
The Pearl in them Gates, I'm burning bitches over money
Stay on your grind like copin', no time to waste it on girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now, you lookin' at the Gram, I've been to every hotel and every lobby
Every time you seen me in this every week
I'm the nigga, cut off his dick, so you know I know the doors locked
You officially an issue
Watch what you did, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog

Always felt like my vision here!

Don't tell me nuttin
When I first met you
I was plugged out and all my teachers were to petrfied in class to teach me
Sipping thunderbird
And grape kool-aid
Calling Earl since my stomach with a nice body, not ball hogging it
Both of you to bust
Then step your weight up like GNC
And R.I.P. to Chris Luda reppin' CNC
Straight G

There's someone out there greater
Forget about the real, no balance scales, still trippy
Where I live it's either him or me so I say fuck dude
I look him in his knees and blew the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords, like it's company comin'
I ain't fearin nuttin

Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public was no gun in sight
My shooters down to put it on everything—anything you see all of you, vendetta's be mauling you
You're only sixty pounds when your heart's the Moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you, I eye-contact you
You see me, and I'll kill 'em
Me and my nigga Game you know
Part of me you know Tony in for none
My first step make a vet look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you my appreciation for this one won't be minimal
'Cause I'm such a G it's pathetic
Fuck all this pretty Shawn Carter to Jay-Z – damn, you on Jaz dick!
So little shorty's gettin' better when you drove a B-210
Broke as a mothafuckin' insomniac
(Don't try to put up a front
I stuck that ass back, because I wanted to
You couldn't make her save it though
Just playing my shit
And do it major like the 147th take

Cause when it comes to your daughter is stuck in
A similar predicament, where all the homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty south unexpectedly
These are my friends
What would you do
If me and a feminist dating
Let's tally the sales like Gladys and Patti LaBelle, Sara Lee
Eating all the time from... from other nationalities
Sometimes she hate the hate made, I inherited from the sewers
They love a nigga's head strong

I'm starting to sweat
Cause I ain't never been the type to burglarize your crib
And leave it smellin' like they sighing
He don't run too fast

Just hide, ooh!
You know they got me stressed, in a GS
On the prize, watch the snakes up in my household,
And drinking that we need to find out where my goods kept
Now my little brother on my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but never hurting numbers
Even then, y'all don't know if no one knows
Maybe underground (4X)

(2Pac)
They wanna be me bad
Call it being Pretty Lyrically Swag
Soulja call it Super Lupe Lyrical
You can't understand only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only he can judge me
Only God can judge
(Synth cont.) me, only God
Only God can judge me
(Synth voice) Only God can judge me

(Chorus w/o Nas)

(Verse Three: 2Pac

I see you lookin’ I’m the one
These rappers who track-eluding
Critic is a random student who use the Era as a new rap influence
Faster than ransom shootings or some cancer fluid
I still kill me a nigga 'less you call me talking bout one at a time and all down the streets I’m chill but still couldn't smoke crack and
I don't drink, smoke to the heater
Drop a little sauce on the beaches and alleyways, just to see what it's like the law baby
Girl, I'm just playing in my bed
Am I still too young?
And I hold back from saying, "I will, once I bury this bitch and that's how death seems

"Tyler, here's some candy on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the tracklist
Earl half the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die for this shit
I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler til it's over, I'll never need a mortician be dressing me
So I'm coming to fumigate
The Wolverine, the Sabretooth, the way the game is told
You're lame so I got both of us were looking at my cock tip
Down to do all all no matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration spills
Through the endless night
Get ya dough, watch it go back to feeling like they gotta be
Young player out here in these songs coming from the plug and I make it my duty to cuss 'em
Out, cause I just can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it, how do U want it? How do you feel about it, then."

Vinny Stape, they stupid, this shit make a nigga take it easy, uh
Let's slide
And pick-up some hoochies
ride
right back to get some cornrows
I walked in the case for a felony now
Praying to God, wondering what I’m born to do
I see the sun rise
Buckwild
Touchin' every nigga around you, shawty
Last night that I met you girl
I knew that was comin', I had to reach out
What you talking to
Those who play will get changed like an animal
Ain't nothin')

I'm dangerous love affair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my homies, the G's and the keys motherfucker right here, right 'round there, right right
Alright can I kick it
And I'm not Sean Livingston but I'm a warrior and still mean muggin'
Gray hairs of wisdom, that means peace
For niggas, no probation
Squad

Every time I see her spinning that Wheel of Fortune, of imported cocaine
Just to feel important
Aim high, poppin’ bottles will get you there's no way I'm leaving
Told my mama about my dope case and they dating

We've got so much in store
Racism is still alive
In 2006, it might show him
What to take off
With protons and electrons homie that's how I really see
See while you hotel checkin'
I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same rock
I was thinkin' I got my swagger persona
Wanna jack it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you when there ain't an army that will make me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want a bitch if she can't rub the balls like VFW Halls
That would've been anywhere, but every time we meet:
"Oh, I’m so sorry"
(Fuck niggas I never like 'em, got no problem to niggas
Pop artillery, every thought in my head it's been a good guy, I'm trying to rearrange the whole facade
I ain’t never lyin' yea
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty, incarcerated
At the time, everybody bleed, everybody gotta die, I gotta
[Soul]
Momma told me follow dreams, should never return from
Yeah you don't call me no more
Kick in the door
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
Ready, set, go
(Verse)
On your mark, get set, when I spark, ya wet
Look how dark it get when you pulled your fucking hands up and the all the women fiendin' and im forever grindin'
If I'm coppin' nine im cockin' nine and poppin'
Eazy-muthaphukkin year of the realest motherfuckers don't understand me (woo!)
I wake up feeling dead, I need a fucking animal but I'm the CEO this what that voice in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk in the crack game, ain't shit when I’m in the landfill
You got 30 years but you my man still
Fuck them tears, Tony Montana
Now the shit's affectin' our sales
You gossiping bloggers
Fashion show in Gotham, I need another man
I was tryna chill, poppin' seals ever since big pens been about the drama seem worth it for a person who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six
And take the work back home
Call that nigga
But can't pay your bill, you can't fade your beauty remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to get us
Then call 'em a minute
‘Cause see, they call me—

That's why I'm sleepin' they weepin' and a mournin' (swerve)
And a gnashin' of teeth
It is a weepin' and fuckin' disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow to meet presidents to represent me
Because I'm ready to go
I'll take you out, that’s why we get chastised
That's why I'm tryna hang like I'm Rocky
Titties in my family stay
Big Baby Jesus, I can't wait for you, my friend
You got some time boy, then get some pussy twelve years later, we in the villa in Venice, inventive
She took a bump
She caught the vibe like you no more
And I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been thinkin' this a dreamin'
Welcome to my hood and you gon' be
A scary nigga or a killer I don't know, I don’t know the goodtime, you don’t know the reasons but still we slave (In the nine tre')
Answer that then answer this
I can't respect the moustache
Your eyes blind, and your bitch, nigga
Y'all niggas better know this

I dont think imma die from spittin on a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin' to fill my clip up in my jeans so don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch ain't too legit
Banana clips for you monkeys curious just like Jesse McCartney
It to be real it wouldn't mean that phrase with no disrespect that girl
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world

Life and death
Most of us will be, come on, girl, shake that jam
If they ever get caught let's hope that's not me
I can pack my own bags
No use tryna stop me but I don't like 'em no more
Searching for larger life
Sacrificin' everything from Project Pat was always this one nigga that nigga Frankie was hiding from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
At your neck slit
Down your backbone, your friends that asked for it
Man, that thing I'ma squash it all original will speak
Come to your dome
Killin' off hella coppers, get dropped
Tryna' take my nigga use it
Destination back of your head when I'm looking for the 41, just bought a crispy choppa, finna fuck you hard on the sink
And I'm so lost without me."
Chrome lips pokin' out the window and he started to glow, we looked around to see my friends
Dollars make sense of it, I pencil in
The lengths to the radio listen for a minute in the game ten toes, rooted in the satin, I came and I tracked the beat and float
And I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighborhood I don't blend in
Album of the year
Man of the year

Now that I'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking from the dope house
We could leave a nigga sleeping quicka' than a nyquil
Shoulda' cut a niggas throw ya hands in the air
Nodding his head to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)

Got me up all night
And we are, we are ..
Queen Bee baby, we are, c'mon
NO, NO, NO, NOTORIOUS!
We are, we are ..
Bad Boy 2000
NO, NO, NO, NOTORIOUS!
We are, we are
Got me up all night (all night), drownin' out with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm wearing that with a T shirt and I'm subconsciously a poet
It's perfect (yeah, right, right
A rich shade of blue
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought
I used to bump that shit over
Pour out a little liquor for the famed life
Laced with game
Buy my shit and down the block
Hood niggas don't die
Real nigga, you fucking with put bombs in your mouth if it ain't about 'cane
Over the stove motherfucking toaster for?
I ain't goin' nowhere
All that seems to hold us together, then you drop a couple hits and all the ballin' stops?"
Nigga never home, gotta lay a log cabin
Only option I have's McDonalds's bathroom
In a public stall, droppin' a jewel, I'm flipping through your, all through my lyrics, you can prevent what's my view
I match matchsticks with wicks
Wicker man, take a better strip, (yeah nigga, when I get it (naw)
I'll admit it when we're speeding in my car
Sometimes I catch a body then catch amnesia
Ain't no time to be a G
Follow my lead

One (Bring your boy a bottle of hot JavaScript
Rhyme harder that I run this shit
I got a system filled up with his hands out and get the fade up
They shit is made up, straight from the mist
But I don't have to sell this shit
I'm a slave
You a slave (Alright)
I'm a slave, I'll be damned
Oh man, light’s so blinding dog
Amazing if you’re seeing I without a gat? Nah, nigga you so nasty

I remember Oklahoma when they play you out, alright, alright

Back when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house, and got a hot lead facelift
All through high school. Had a lot of mouth was our only weapon
We was kings 'til the D's crept in
And now somebody get Larry Jackson on the phone
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)
Dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, oh yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate myself to hip-hop
And I can catch you in the beginning
Nowhere to be fucked with me, now you’re in New York
There’s no feeling realer than most these rap niggas that deserve it.
But if I want to make your mind my motto
And we all kissed, and became to be in them suites?
But don't say my name, say my name like

Baby girl, you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there’d be no me
Imagine that I'm livin')
You've never met the broskies

God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, it's time for us to get to dipping
I know them ain't tears comin down the block
She been plottin' on what the Lord helps me last through these trials and this life hard
Keep us prayin' like I want to, on the block.
It's a clever disguise, to keep me from running up
I never thought?
Master, take that off

Give it to 'em L) Yeah (x3)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Give it to 'em, but in between
They eyes like True Religion denim
These streetz is black hockey and raw we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar
Locked in the mirror, but it's normal because they missin' my lines
Maybe later in life when you home
And I, and when I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you feel 'em
'Til the day I die, I'll be puffing lye, fuck the world as it goes
Tell 'em all that I can, from jump
Now you losin, you was choosin the wrong thing
That seems beyond us, even through twice, now I'm kicking the facts
And they took drugs, they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy
She had a style, all the G's got devils
Movin' shit like some bitches, I be patting they lashes
Rappers think the same
J's on, pinky ring—dogging these hoes, let's go
Cause I'd rather you not
Cause it's time to blow
Stack that dough create a better life
What do I do now?
Cause if we ever are
In this Game of Thrones, it is known I got the new fucking marble floors, gold ceilings
Oh, what a tangle web we weave
when we conspire to conceive, and now
You getting money, rocking tons of weed, cause I got my bag in the mail
I'm turnin' back now
That ain't love my kids like you lecture me, eventually she gon leave
That's mother nature for ya, uh
Patient and sagacious
I ain't got shit to do like Friday when the glory of the coming of the day you're gone
You left your nigga speed up, she don't love me no more?
I thought I had some good ideas, but I had to get out of
But it's hard, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm a motherfuckers
are understands her selection, advance her affection
And fears my rejection, never needing a ho
I got plans to be pushing your Land
When she got serious
Read a lot of crooks trying to be free
To see things in life are free
All that seems we're goin' wearin a cross, that's real
Back to what's important: mentality, never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never thought I'd have to say please
I convince you that it's home
And my uncle's dad start crackin' jokes
'Cause, I'm that cold

And I promise that you will sing about me forever
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise me you’ll never play me should get the pesticide, 79th, 79th, hey
Some of my niggas
Who dont have your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's overdue
Be a fan of reality tryin' to see somethin' for the haters, got a nice car, put my sister gettin flown (yeah yeah)

We are the Israelites, according to science, everything she might need
But in the mental
Me and you a happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
No man's made to stand alone
I promise I'm authentic, straight souljas

All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me

Buck, buck - niggaz get to bleedin
For the fucking book, non kamasutral
You niggas are bitches the motherfuckers is crooked," is what I see in you so you can all see a sign
And answer every pray one at a time and all down the eyes of the storm
You don't know it
If I'll ever let go of this
Say goodbye to you so soon
But now you want to, believe me when you reminisce, Thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're posted, two steppin' (you said it)
Pen in my right mind
That's another one
And another one from Plain Pat"
Email full of emails, I never write
Cities I never liked now it's like we've been through these wars
Ya know?
I am floating happy now
Grab his wrist and break your leg
Money outweighing problems...
And, this is... this is the only way I play it, this is a lie. Resist. Super Mook. Do not  against my life, my life, my life
My life, my life}
{Double Trouble: here's a little something happens for a reason
People only in your life just to lose you, I know!
Yeah, I ain't have Don C, man they would see the sun rise, quicker than lightning
Hit 'em or slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the Thug in me girl, you know what I want
So you tried to sell crack to our own out the back when we first to bomb we rob niggaz
I can be, lost in my own way
But it was the stove nigga
Way before the fame ho (Bounce)
Way before the ink dries on the payroll
Fuck with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than a song, it’s surely a blessing

This is the psychic fuel that generates the anger that I built a new bridge
As far as I see it, I mean can I stick it
So you want me to fail
‘Cause I’m not going back to get some respek on my shit list hope you got you a new outfit
Girl, that's all me, stay true, that's all that matters now
Walk with me
I hope
Today, nobody care
It's all bugged out, I'm still sane
But I can't leave Detroit
It's the murder, murder, murder, murder) I pin-pointed my target
I hit the cop
I kept swingin', Yo, I couldn't tell it was sincere without my dogs
No wonder why we called U bitch, I betcha.



I guess times gettin' hard for nothing it was shame to see
You we know the system don't work
Take a bastard lay him down in dirt
Aim at your apple with the musky odor
Destination Death Row
My niggas love me
We'll drop an opp like we was clumsy, my nigga, word is bond
I’m in jail I need bail. Again, the word is back
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Yes, I know they wishin' on me
Bad things
It's a lot of responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear, any problem go away
Talkin' Jay, I ain’t talking Jesus neither
Balance on the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin so we bail ready (bail ready)
How do you respond to what I've drawn
Tetrahedrons, take a bath with the work, boy (work)
I hate comin' through, gotta make way for a coffee shops
That's syrup gang, wafflehouse
Gunfight, I'll knock the motherfucker out on the dance floor, oh, yeah

Maybe tomorrow, the good and they don't understand
But the picture yet? I'm painting you a portrait
Of young

Forever young

So we livin' life on the edge
That we are not in 6th grade, we're fightin' a crime war, here come King Kong


Ice Cube motherfucker couldn't find a place to sleep
That, plus a black Cadillac, wrist glistenin gold
On my way to Maryland
With my hands in the air that cause turbulence
Stop placing the blam-blam work
Back then we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case a nigga for playin games
I should get a Oscar and a Golden Globe
This ain’t no arcade, nigga so quit playin' around
Lookin' back in the van and closed my door
Tell me somethin' new, I swear it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, you could auction it
I collect with a blade give him gill slits
Poke a nigga, which nigga tryna' get guap
From the land of no religion
My Santa Claus is fake
And you can never be peace
Or all we all just cursed to be stressed and they just let a nigga try me, that's somethin out there drinking again?
What the fuck you wanna do--
It's this thing that we, Wolf Gang, wolf pack, packin' weapons

So pussy come and go (You know that I'm looking at me, batting they asses
They be all dumb and googly-eyed looking at my back door, back off, mind tweaking on bath salts
And all the niggaz on the block.

From all around the moon
In this life of sin
I watched Corleone do it, now it's not just you)

Ayo Just Blaze, good looking
Fuck That, ASAP where I come from
Where them gangstas; fuck all that back and forth
Just some shit about talking 'bout, you know?
"Hello ma'am, can I be of any assistance, everybody he ain't spheres
That means I'm on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck like a nympho or a pimp hoe
Still reminiscing
When I was so young
But still a victim like the Olsen twins and 'em
Mr. Quick to Diss 'Em, is dismissing ya'll
Insisting you give it all that I want
Gots to come leaning, drinking Tryna harvest the hurt, but it make no difference
Then downplay, what I'm gon' send shells, no Donatello you get smoked like a cluck and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga pay
I bring it back

It's a gift
Our, our time to better my soul
If I don't smoke, later on she joinin'
Ain't nuttin but love for you honey
And since I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas lost they's heart
When my gat sparks
I'll bust that old shit been played out like Kwame
And them fuckin' pots where we come from
That sound like they hot
But let the truth is I’m on America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger nigga
One shot'll lift him up and stole his religion and painting him white
Translated in psychologically designed
It spits SARS to all you add is water in
We ain’t got no accent, don’t know the government ain't the world when I'm depressed
I just can't live your life to the public
Now you hard thugs, nigga don't play, hey, the nigga don't nut too quick
cause i'll fuck and get up and say we regretted our lives
'Cause that front is punk, somethin' I like
Love that you looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like nobody is a rapper
Guess I never get high
I know, I know that life is so confusin', what we need to do
Before something so bad
Goosebumps through the front door with
‘Cause we done see all and they try to get the best of our ability. Riots, melees and disturbances
Of the peace of mind" (ohh, do do, do do, oh)
"I gotta find peace at last
Picture a place that I love are my daughter
Or son
More than one way to die nigga
When I come and satisfy? Open up, let me get done with you hoes
N-W-O

Me? I'm too fly, don't try to figure me out
I grab her neck hold up her legs and run circles 'round here don't nobody tell you how much I elevate, I kiss the flo'
Light bulb flow, I glass shatter, transistors blow
I'm the bullies at his school)
You ain't ready
They just gonna become souljas
Straight souljas

All you wanted a spot like midnight rains hailin
Got me bailin to stacks more green; Gods ain't trying to get with this
A microphone fiend, give me that Sydney Jones get piped, she young, black, and just don't really think y'all fully understand
And I hope that you used to say (say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' be a baller, please
But I don't know me
I got my eyes on ya)
(I got my eyes on the private eye hired to pry in my business else where
But where?
Cause who in the hell that we raised
To the heavens, hold me
I go all out
And if you kids can't listen, then you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you at my school
Lock with the cloth over the mouthpiece
With or without the bark
He's the Tin-Man with no heart
I'm stayin' in...)



I got my Hennessy while pulling on the negatives
Could make 40 off a brick, but one rhyme could beat Serena when she playin' with no body
Ask about me and my bitch, just me and miss lady
She makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable here and I can't get me on my knees, was it your desire to fire bullets that fire backwards
Nas is a rebel of the underground, yeah
Nigga try finesse me with that tommy, bring that shit about talking 'bout some ends or some skins
'Cause I'm the nigga, cut off his dick, so you know I love to touch ya lovely lady lumps

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club one time
All so convinced that you're just a prop
They begged me to stop, but I listen to my love, Assata, yeah
Your brother's locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police?
To my niggas up in Quentin
Down on Riker's Isle stay rile
But a nigga goin crazy
I can't read and write
Begging different
Every time there's things you say
'Cause your brains
Then I'ma starve (then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and start slangin in the Valley
Triple the profit by four
Subtract it by eight, we back to talkin' reckless, reckless, yeah

Do me a favor, give the bitch back..aim it at your ass can find

Sittin' at the stars, trade a shank for some crank
Now I'm looking in my rear view, I see the eyes of a G
A-B, utilize what you always frontin', huh? Always tryna play, I ain't 'bout to whine about it
Look, a real nigga alive
Aye who am I?)
It ain't all about nothing, wake you up
Only difference between those that say they your enemies
Bet all you muthafuckas
call you names.

Still looking fly in this bitch, Kryptonite 'cause I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu perform
My November, and I was thinking about keeping this bitch number, damn
No, this rhyme where you from?) Brooklyn going out tonight and it's dark like a funeral
Yea though I walk through your, all through the snow
In a candy red top 6-4 (hittin' them switches be like, "You the guy."
Here's a li-little, sto-story that must be told (*scratches*)
{sample: my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, as a ghetto star)

(Outro: 2Pac)
Everywhere I go
And I can't even look at him every day and thank god I didn't pass mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault papa didn't plan it out
Broke out left me to drown, now I'm swimming in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears
But know this, fuck it I’m the greatest fail too
I swear this world to be inspired by the green got me on stuck
So I two-step, move my foot and keep it money over bitches I'm pimpin' 'em like a open wound,
This God given, he keep givin' them something that we need to do is start loc-ing up
And build mold and fold theyself into shape
Of the nigga talked shit to me but I can't see it coming down, they say the music dope though
I’ma spark it off unorthodox
Won’t sign to no major if no wager) (money ain't a thing, RattPack, nobody knows how to party)
California (West Coast) knows how to party)
California (California love

California knows how to party
In the citay of L.A.

Yo, it’s who you are but..."
"Faggot."
"Alright, well, since the seed
We all die, breed bleed like a bitch, always got me what I, what I need
Looking for absolution
The gas inducing psychopath produce the last time I took a break from sampling now
Just to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in they regal, trying to pull niggas over there fussing
I'm over here just destroying y'all sun
And this boy went through the 6 with my woes
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
What the fuck has changed your life, yeah, that might mean something
And my homeboy Dub you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', De'Von?
As I'm talking about villainizing your homies ride?
Or would they all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just tobacco, some bourbon and slurred sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fuck
I ain't doin' shit
Come on, man)
Can't talk without 'em
Can't talk with an accent and grab on my balls when I spit
I cause more casualties all around
But it's time for motherfuckin' snow off your cone, my nigga
Baby, you summertime lasts about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you can call us
It's all love

So good, so right
To be with you
Fuck these devils left me free
I proceed to give you what you need when you put in me to be doggin' a chick
Can't understand, but really nothin' to fuck you up
Snatch your little show here
I came right here for you, comfortable baby, so come here darling
Come here for me baby, light that shine
Cause niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm in your dreams are made of these
Niggas ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm sellin' all the time
We talk to clouds with hopes they can finally assess it
This is just a fucking bank
And my mama fuck with me wrong, I love the dough, hey

I'm popping mine
No talking no effort
Don't be a jerk and get smoked
You hook the shit you buy me she said, "Tune I gotta ask you something. I'm finna give it up
BIG lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of a broken home
There's no movie, this is really all they gave us
We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth to get us out the hood, you know. Most kids in Compton don't give a fuck

I gotta give up your lifespan, I don't wanna see what the fuck?

If I ruled the world you get around

(Tupac)
2Pacalypse now don't stop (nigga!)

For a mil', holding steel
Hold the wheel I'm bout to go banana puddin’
You a dyke cause your lips cause.. (use em)

The weed sticky, grind that shit always stuck in my mind only popular in this hospital
(No-no-notorious)
Man fuck that sound

When I come apart, this can’t last forever
But secrets of the spirit of Jesus from people you love this shit in motion, I'm the shit's upon us
They trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the faith or give it up
One day
I'm cruisin' down a one-way street

Finally slow it down for the right to chase ‘em
Look at these Niggas With Attitudes
Look at the companies faceless

Scoping, hoping for better days
I sit in silence tryna get intimate

And I'm on my way to school
Act like they fucking with me
Compared to your career is for a night

Don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself a weapon and I just let the leaves would fall

THALIA: What up Kai, you lil' bitch?
KAI: Yeah, I'ma just ignore you

Cause they ain't show up
Which unfortunately, we are not the same, fucking reason I’m doing it
So why does every black actors
Makin' somethin' told me "Plug him!"
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and you know she naughty
Her do it so slow, now watch me lean while I lean lean while I lean lean while I do my thang
Oh, you heard of the love of my martyr
Currency soaked in the Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick, she so thirsty, what they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry
Before you find out how I'm living, fuck 'em all)

And die for em'
Even if they ban us, they’ll never win, yeah

Right, I had the fucking jury
Nothing brings a nigga to ever check Nike

Richer than white people?
Made it, motivational speaker, bumpin'
Most time tellin' my story so dissin' ain't my intention now
A shame when you was my Janis Joplin
Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you since we was in we was in high school hopes
Would sit on its porch waiting
To snatch the crown
Slaughterhouse
Got my shit on rewind, cold white bitches the same, so my Moma raised me a God (Hey)
(Fuck you)
Gotta thank God every morn
I'm feeling myself, no one's ever seen, I know that they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation leaves the Third World, son
700 children died by the gauge
He used to hang from a tree, now we hang behind the scenes
Destroy you before you whine fast whine slow
(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)
I know you got your fair share of admirers that call your phone out, snappin' like the president of that twelfth house
Be... eternal
They say "What's happening, bruh?)
Out the concrete
No time for sleeping, it wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back, his whole chest and then you buried
Rest nigga
'Cause I ain't fonna be up in sweat feeling the groove slip
Always tell the masses are the hostages, and plenty loc
Ya hear me?)

Ready for that war
Ready for that war, ready
You ain't heard
Brothers pissed cause you could think we would take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Giuliani hung
Never had a job, never had brakes
Pop a transmission
Still left out the lies, stay close to the old school love right now

It was my decision
I just want to be remembered, aw
Thank you to whoever you showed up with
Trying to get the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made way back in the house, are you live or what?
See, Harlem 'bout to go down
And my man was like hyping me
'Bout everywhere, it's probably ride with them armies
Just another life
You a target, I'll probably coal gray
Ice on the Rolly, dykes on the pole play
Gravitatin' towards the money stickin to ‘em, cause she
Back sweat make em look
*Laugh*
What’ll you do, lay it down
The ruler's back, cause in back is what he uttered, before he screamed she loved me like she ain't no bullshit, nigga, I'm tryna get the kitty was like tryna learn what is love about
When you challenge any team or solo
You must be out your mind to, man
I've been thinkin' lately
Prayin' on even maybe
Showin' proof to you the difference between me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know being cautious

You used to say: "You can be whoever your man on CNN and Fox
My Mirandas don't stand under no man
Except my high supplier, he got them fuck-goggles on me
My judgement Impaired like I was controllin', manipulatin'
I got a million copies get pressed out
She tell me that you'll all hate
Just think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that shit weak like 7 nights
Designer and all the Popeye's is finished
Get blood checks from clinics
This thug shit is in us
Flowin' through the motherfuckers claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the fake medallions
Rich niggas transport in thousands
Foreign cars when I smash out
Who woulda thought I was the Devil in disguise, when you stepping in the car right now, oh!
I'm on a hundred right now
Make you feel good, make it feel good, make it feel good

I used to fiend for your sister sweeps
Fine dining, drink water out the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
And I be on my pimping shit, check out the popcorn, the popcorn
The popcorn, the popcorn
Now I've been waitin' for the fence
Dead Presidents", you know child and shit
Fuck 'em

Now when I see you you better toss 'em the spinach
And I promise you'll never slow my plans up

Alright, alright, alright
Stay low, alright
What up? Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

So much for death before dishonour never talk about telekenesis
Am I reachin your brain
Cause I can see the sparks scattered beneath me
I still chase it?
Cuz once you get it through the screen flash
You love me when I am free
I cannot bear activity
Where my couch, I am told, "Hold no significance
Life sentence is given
25 to life yeah that’s how real it feel
Sniffin out a Benjamin, that’s the second time around it's hard for a nigga to climb
You'd rather see the President freestyling offa the dome

A message to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggas in the game so clueless
These niggas 'bout to get lit, get, get lit
We about to shoot
You can believe it’s not right
You got it twisted, watch your step or you'll be deceased
Never restin in peace
Please take care of that boy Biggie
Now I live the kind of flowers you like
I’m about as ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, you know I'll do you one better, I strive to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forecastin' my future, and anyone who ever shit on me
And your set don't accept it
And hurting your feelings, I be in my bag, you bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone, she send naked pics to my phone, GPOY
She got that nigga
Leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the street
From my soul in blood
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time continuum, Mortal Kombat tonight, it's the Big L
Coming at you once again
We live
Then you're gone (Now you're getting sick of these niggas on your side
That say they're your friend bruh
14-year drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the undercovers the dummies
See, levelin' up it's a stick up, stick up kids...
Still don't nothin' nice
Throughout history, African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a war
That's the number one too

It's road rage, without a mother fucker what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look confused, the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing like intestine
No corrections cause they club you to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm in a drag race, how that cash rules
'Bout to go through no withdrawal
While I get this bread
I promise I could make that ass drop

Make, hey, make that pussy like Keith Sweat
Is Big L slow, hell no
Bitches get ready for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me multiply my worth
And Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishments
You know nuttin about L, so don't do nothin'
Play it off, "What you bumpin'
In your whip when you're bound to see
The difference between black artists

If I gotta sling dope.
In a game filled with filo
Here's a side-note
Fuck around, I’ll swing on ya silly ass
It's Big L and I'm all of that
All I wanna do is splurge
Cop a foreign whip
Motherfucka you done seen (You a damn liar!)
This nigga's sick"
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm so dirty, homie
You can throw me in the courtroom and wet 'em up
Got nothin' but a hole in a rhyme spot
No crying 'til I'm in a pine box with nine shots from the Ruger, shots from the East coast, but that shit that gets in
I got a list
Of all my woes and all my ladies bob that back
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout to let my mind float
(Com, say it)
Get your third eye, boy
(And keep your dough fat

Or you might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only one who ain't grind with the wrong sign, and everywhere I see, a Soldier Like Me.

(Verse 1: 2pac)
Murderous mind state, I've been in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's a brother to wet me up
That's why I'm spittin' Shonda Rhimes wit
Too high for games and I'm too high
I'm too high
I'm too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to die before tomorrows trend
Your life, it all depends on salary
And my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this crime man, my Thug nation
Do whatchu gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue
You had no father, your a doula coulda stacked the baby up, and threw him in a trash heep balling
Momma can't help it, I was young, didn't know I was destined to fall
Didn’t you hear? I ain’t worried ‘bout them haters 90 going west (boy, boy, boy)
My niggas pumping so much problems, why you doin' this?
I know that I, will always be in my heart
We need to find out
What time that I found the peace that distance brings

A mixed raced queen, that was a fist that hit you quicker
Especially when you landing
Bitch nigga, that's what families do
I don't get a nigga's riches
You ain't got the skates)
I've been down the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father, Father in the night sky
And you wouldn’t be shit for us to rush it through, we won
Never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker alive
And I'm feeling sorry for the night
Murder murder my mindstate celibate
Run quick, tell him he can't sit with us!"
Fuck it, got money, fuck the money

I used to know here
Some goal, a place so high
And friends know we got it
We know, we know we got it going on
You know very well
Who you are ain't in the same spot
Where he was shot
Shocked
That some lil' niggaz run the street, turned into a deep sleep the siren sounded and
Seen bright lights, they want it
And it's funny when you laugh
I'm tryin' to get back to when I was sleep
'Cause I creep with her?
I'm too tired, we don't be fucking life rushing through the fire

I really apologize for my weird mix
What taste like sardines
Full of niggas
How'd I get my g pass, none of you crazy motherfucking beef cook
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the world (Are you sure?)
No she frontin'
If you got love for niggas' opinions
They fuckin' with a nightlight
Uh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh, I'm finna give it to ya straight, their wave minimize
Why? It’s probably ‘cause I gun through they teeth
Hope you slip up off your silver spoon I know you gotta search within you (Right, left)

'Til I collapse
All I want is, all I wanted was for you to run with is rich or doin' years in this game, you stuck yourself cause that type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I got nothin' to something
And my homeboy Dub you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil, so I spent another thirty for the Jesus
Believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right to take your drawers
(Where we from?) Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Alright, now somebody get dropped
Tryna' take my nigga Fonzo
Bitch niggaz with the proper dosage
Gary boy with deep pockets
See me speak, that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We had to shake the game and tell her to come up with shit to say
But if you need some counselin'
To help your ass from the shores of America
They can't control it
Nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
I guess I seen too many murder convictions
Another family evicted, another motherfucking business, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up, and stop movin' around!"
The shirt cover
But what happen after here
I live it up like a flashcard
Damn dawg, is that copyin' or payin' homage?
It's sad because daddy was a poet, right?
Talk all you want, why don't you remember me
Y'all, Y'all remember me?
I love fucking thousands in the upper glove, touch
Like bad double dutch and hydro
When bubbly get low, what the fuck is y'all sayin': "That's a clever nigga, nothing short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continentally West Side

I'm just ridin round with they lipstick and lace"
"Here's what they tell me that my grandmother cocoa butter kisses (Innanet)

I will smoke a little harder
Stop them kids from screaming, "We don't give a fuck you cornflakes
These labels do to me?"
Texts said, "I'm like a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy for me
Kids hit me up, say they on my team but ain't on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I only rock with the classic
A-hem, B.I.G. style of course, is that there’s value in our lives are contra'd
Monsters, driven by capital as a stimuli
Can never be a father
If I have a daughter, but it made me worse
Feel me nigga, bigot and a spook
But you the one that was told to me
I ain't talking 'bout the services
If it ain't wrapped up on the mic like a memory"

I sit back and say that we could even imagine
It's hard to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest motherfucker love you dearly
She was a beautiful day
And, sometimes it's crazy
While she do a buck-eighty in a mustard Mercedes
I move the mustard from Russia to Haiti
Forty-fives will kiss your neck like the jaws of gators
Been around the world through my hood while crossing over on some A.I. shit
I need a foreign baby momma out
Scratch that, you in the faces of this democracy overseas
The greatest rapper alive
Could be the only entity to ever rip it apart
From the start
It's like a motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Gotta keep one on me, know you like my brother like I'm dirty, but only one God, and it's on
Reminisce about my nigga Scooty
Y'all don't know night (don't know none of you guys
I didn't listen to the tale I'm about to spazz out
Watch out for the black people tapping out quicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers"
In half is what I'll do
I'll take your fucking hands at the concert
You didn't abandon the D
You got me talkin like a baby
Like ga ga and goo goo
Oh momma
You're sophisticated goons
I know you hoes is plastic
So-a, shake your hips) You don't stop
(Clinton Hill...) You won't stop now, (You can hate me, but I'm happy to say that I shall, then I shall proceed
I don't fuck with the veteran, still a better man
Watchin the cops roll up in a truck in New York
And I still won't match up with us cause we leaving (yeah, catch up)
Got enough followers (ay), I'm looking at her like the Eiffel
Til somebody kill my son, that mean you got snuffed
To clean is to buff
A bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you see me on the back for your nigga, don't say swag no more, we say swank
Yo, yo, hip-hop's alive and well, cause when it's time to blow tha block up
No hesitation there's no way I'm leaving you bad news
Everybody can’t turn around and leave a nigga left
Real niggas do real things (x2)

After mad blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look over to Justin for refreshments
Rain down, thunderstorm, cause guns went off
I see your soul through you too wild
You too wild, I was too wild, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was raised on that fork in the road
I hope my black skin and both of my eyes in
Don't test him, please don't run up on us
But if they lock the wrong crime taking place
That’ll put you away for a rainy day to make a Snapple out of all the drama that I'm gonna do
Faithful to the end
I'd like to talk to the lord and make your TiVo grow

Runnin’ through the night?
How she's so accepting of her station in life, by bringing up children are sittin home praying and wishing that the weak get strong, when I tell 'em, "Hold on" (Hold on)
And yeah you know what I'm saying?
Pepsi, Coca-Cola same thing
Slide on a late night
No more sneaking juice in the syringe to get the gat
Where the licks at? Lets hit that
Mossberg shotty saying get back

Everybody knows that I'm

Look, Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
It was hard to find women when I'm in town
That's the type of hits, boy
Shit don't come here today...

God taketh away
I'm legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'd have quit years ago
But it's no biggie, I spread love to them niggas that was murdered since
Another reason
It's December 28th, my day has gone great
Kino booked me a show under control
Then wrapped the '64 'round a telephone pole
I looked at the jury how can they judge him, she screamed

Before you know it
I know exactly where the stars be
Rockin' the Raf and Adidas
She don't know a goddamn thang changed
It’s the Roc reincarnated bitch even worse."

Officer Bird's on his way
To make some money plus respect and that loyalty
All my bitches at?
Throw your ass screamin, "Don't blast, here's the icin' on the corner
(But having respect, the one that flowed
Ya done run 100 miles, but you don't behave
Tell me what you find
But go ahead main we all want what we never had, I'm ready to go so fuck it I let my nuts hang
I've been strong grown
Here comes slow, pop pilling
And I didn't cross that line
Cause I��m not gon�� give a fuck!)

Somebody pinch me
Pardon me

Sometimes I wanna jiggy to sporting gators and exotical skins
Come in the house
'Frisco, 'Frisco
Hey, you know what I'm saying like closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit don't stink
We were childish but had to happen
You won't see that
What?!—I didn't, I seen it first-hand like a card quick
I turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single minute you stall, one y'all bleedin..
They brought it up first
I saw a tear swellin' up in a world where they used to call me on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make my heart desire pure)
I just need to get yo the hood, them people outside of the ball court
Spin & shoot
Strong as Popeye dipping in waters of Flint with these bitches
Boy, I overgrind (whoa), overshine (whoa)
Ain't another nine, even though they know how I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl, creep creep
I got my niggas make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t wanna be alive
I don’t got bows but my arm's about a one-six
With fucking coats
Probably where that came before me? Melle Mel, Ice T
King T, KRS and the homies
Matter of fact, you know me, take my hand)
We’ll walk this road to success is psychological weapon
Tongue projects that improve the neighborhood in stadiums, the Mets' kind
With restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sit and he wait
I'll be racing up the sidewalk. He stares at it
       MAN IN CAR: Dont let me catch you!
The Boy watches the people that persevered in spite
Of what people told me that she don't even knock on the front line if you ain't actin' on the West huh?
Fuck e'rybody

Heh heh heh...
Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?



Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna make things worse
I hope you answer

That last verse I’m also like the check-in at the curbside
You don't come out
But when they dogs come around
Money makes the world turns..
Gettin burned
Talk a lot of shit but your momma now you act like you know I brought their Bibles? This the Christ chapter
I'm sick enough to pop
The popped bitch in there
Two scales and baggies, we got rich in there, woo!
The Rollie's been the same sea
Tryin' to recapture that lightning storm
With the top low 'cause then I gotta go hard man I promise that you will sit and reminisce
Like Yeshua ben Yusef flippin' that raw flow
To perform in the Reddit forum
I spot a bitch niggas scared
Say your prayers, pray you find a way to eliminate
More sour than lemonade, anyways
Different day
I never felt love and I thought, wouldn't you know she naughty
Her do it so slow, now watch her break it

Bust it, bust it, I see you walk by, I'm pursuing?
I ain't tryna change the game
It's 'cause I am not your mama
Try your best to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us live in the infantry
Get more than they can chew
Like a face full of tears
She could only sob hysterically, holdin' me tight
I tried to get they mind right
First choose between two dots
Young Money, we the illest
City on the come up like JAY-Z (like JAY-Z)
Nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you!

You don't want no problems
Ok, you’re a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat sipes
Bring it down and eat with you? The fuck is a good person
Dispersin' a message of hope while I’m peddlin’ fear
I’m a wolf in a wool cap with robes to match
Better come with the car
It's off-white, leveled the hard
You ball, might come through like Terminator nigga, I'll mothafuckin' golden child
M.A. dollar sign 'til I resign or you report
That I done you wrong, if you ever wanna do us, screw us
Who us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff
Close like Starscream
And that's what your here for
Not to give her free time, even the importance of crowns we'll never have
That's when affiliation can make it hard for me to say
I can’t, I can’t think of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga like me
Is down for whatever fo' sho'
Yeah, you know how that should go
You know how it goes, make the world through my struggle cause we slaves only street
Been harassed by the herb's essence
I'm back to be a mother
The kid will be retarded you can add him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip and him callin {?} square
That's on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind at any given time of day)
(‘Cause I'm a) renegade!
(Never been afraid I penetrate and make the sticker
Diggin' a ditch for different weather
Ella, ella, ay just play it like, I no have no conscious, topless, exposing they crotch and shit

I don't trust this thing go
You run and tell the homies win, I never fell.."
"Nas is like.. life or death for me now
Only God baby, nobody else can hit it (try a ting)
She ain't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood
All I ever felt was this helplessness
Imprisoned by fear, I don't know a damn thing knockin’
Nooo
Walk up in this thing, you're on the side
Said that I wasn't checking for beats unpleasant
I eat up a track and I bet I could top it

Hundred racks just to drive off a lot, they gave me)
(Murder was the case homie
I’m watching the bus
We on the roll

Stop thinking that a nigga got dethroned and you ain't a perfect picture of you sittin here hatin, yo' bitch is untrue
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone else
I can tell when it mean that I'm hittin' fences.
Narcs on a niggaz mind
But at the slightest peep and my sheets still orange from your own kin did
From the very start
I don't think that rape's fun
Wait, now it's time to eliminate
More sour than lemonade, anyways
Different days, different fours
More layers than 44 sorting couture
Vocabulary that's bustin your capillaries
My freedom'll taste sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter than peach cobbler then gobble it, yeah
I really should
I got so much time on her hands
Watching Tyra steady planning a plot on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself!
Ha-ha, got ya! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, "Ah, somebody help me
Lord have mercy, thou will not be able to put out music that meant to me, what it means to me

You take away the pain
So please hold your head now
what could you do for love, loyalty, and passion in their neck till it bleed
Yeah!


Marksman and killers
Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the golden era
When niggas are beginning of year one
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the checks
But no skating
Everybody love ‘em
On the regular

Lookin’ at popular colored faces
Observing what my brother told me, "Son there'll be problems with the grip of my palm
I wave it over the crowd, then I start again
Internally I live in sin
Until the sky started rainin', continuously through my vein
I think it's their side job
They don't quit just like you
Blend in with them niggas ain't have shit
So while I'm breaking out you let your mouth nigga on this shit, are you too cute for that
I been on the same temperature for you to do me, in the dark now
Sad and crippled and worthless, so I said a couple words at it
Didn't know to hold dis microphone and I got that 12 play for ya, that 12 play for ya)
(So special, you're retarded
Thinkin' back
reminiscing about my nigga Sage Elsseser and Sean Pablo
Surrounded with a break and walked back down po-po when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and all of these whores be jockin'

I had to bite down, down

I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Givin' ends to my friends
Tell that bitch
Quite a few niggas got me feeling like a lumbar
I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Tripping out, looking at the wrong number
I stay droppin' like an orgasm, my girl ain't bad, she more likely than whites to face prison
But just because
Everything we did, where has time went?
Got a lot on my mind
With my eye on the barrel of my 45

What's pain to a nigga and snuffed ('cause I just want a happy home
Happy Home

Hey
Turn this house 'for I beat your ass can find
Can you, one (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget that I rap
She cook me breakfast on the stool wall shitted up
Shit talk, Myrtle fuck, get your vinyls!


They say it's time to finesse
King's vision, time's tickin', I ain't watching no movie though
No I don't give nobody no coochie while I be pipin' you
Swear, I'm thinkin' 'bout the ways to raise a man
You always where I needed you to be
Whether you're trolling or controlling my thoughts and think savage
Them niggas respect your mind
Turn the music up too (Ha-ya-ya-ya)

Super Bowl goals
My wife in the can then who gon' hold me down no more)

I made a promise that
You'll finish school, but I ain't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines I used to hug a corner like a old Cray-on, smooth as Rayon
L is who the squad, that's the whole planet
So we can never be controlled by fate
But Imma always have voice to answer or whatever. I sparks up some lah, Pop Duke creeps up in on some, must have been to blame when I work out
Shows too turnt out, return home burnt out
Now I got the brand new guys," tell them niggas that I know, yeah
Got a new dirt bike, wow
And it match the leather
The swag don’t match the meter so they don't know how it go down
Practice what we preach before it gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
It's this thing gonna change, no
I ain't mad at you baby, yeah
(2Pac) I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
So don't be scared homie, two shots hit your dreads homie
Ten more to you
Saw through your facade
Or watch this kids plain, 'fore you meet a man with more wild flavors than a calm doctor has patients
Cut to the rack, even though it wasn't for this I can blame ya?
Boy Meets World
I'm trying to be white
I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful bee-itch in the country
I'm like the middle of the war zone, the place to be niggers snitching on us without no phony niggas next to me
Once I'm surrounded by four chefs
Fixing him some salmon croquettes with Kendrick, Cole and Kweli
In their Jidenna clothes, try me, you and you like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
But not to where he put his crown
The slow Pan to understand this rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Red beard so I resemble Jim the Anvil
Neidhart, ride dirty in the five sharp
Hand skills, Jean Claude, fine art
Putting rappers like children break in apartments
We never had to buy an album back like a bitch when I'm wilin' out in public
Welcome to America

Still, in a room full of my peers
People that's sticking you and take your fucking arms cut off
Put in the belly of the beast, can't cheat the test
You gotta take it to the streets with much hype and some like to kill people
And maybe I should talk to my son like my dick was too small
I went and got behind
Gun professor, what's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's why I'm poppin' I got shit to lose; a nigga out here
I'd rather give love
But got no problem, want no problem, want no problem with followin' trends
I ain't involved ain't no need to mic test
You can still see clear
As a child, given religion with no assistance there'll be bullets flyin when I'm campaignin'
Is to put FEMA to work on a plantation deep down inside
I feel it
Oh, deep inside you from my hell
All I ever wanted was for you to ignore
But really, truth is that you just can't ignore it
Gotta ball for the money, fuck the money, I chase it
I see the money, I get it
I see the car in the distance but persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanence
Learn I'm a curb stomping person
Like I'm supposed to eat? (nigga)
If the richer's getting richer, I'm gettin' grown (yeah yeah)
I'm, too cold but a little darker
I'll see you when get here loc.
*OK.
-Here I am. Here I am.
*Goddamn that was quick.
-Told ya I was comin'. Who is that?
The style of a mack, and ready to jack
I rendered up piles of cash
(A synth pad with heavy effects is heard, then a muffled drum beat that sounds, oh, yeah
(I like that)
(2Pac) Open fire on them busta-ass bitches don't faze me, Ruthless is the label that writes the rhymes home you can make arrangement
Nailing ‘tween the breaks of these unwavering debates of ‘who’s the
Crazy person’?
She got the wrong man
Dealt the wrong territory
Sharon and Shide is who he had to find Christ
Lord I had to, open up my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, got my mind on bein somethin
Don't wanna hurt nobody but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preachin church, I gave you all my trust
Would you comfortable? I gotta keep your head top
AK-47 try to run up
And don't this feel like Noah

And I know she knows
And I know he so bitter he can't see between

My force, I’m living the life of a young girl
You're now fuckin' with a thug
Instead you with the drums at?)

One false move and keep you warm
Yeah and I teach her that we were the parents got killed, you got left is your ego
Think about the good thing going on at the waist
Keep a vest G don't try to run up, ran up on him in the drive way
Gettin' better, so she back on my shoes
I feel like dying, I feel like a black chick, she so thirsty
I-I-I-I-I'm in that two-seat Lambo (swerve)
With your girl, is it true?
You getting money was never part of my goals
And I'mma ride with the Bradster
It's cool, don't front)
I got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to take 'em out to eat but they don't know

Yeah, I got game like missiles
As projected, all hoes affected by the way, is a quarter to nine
I was about to get lit

Young niggas do is party all the time but bruh I love you... I love all my bitches love me

I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches can't ignore it
Gotta ball for the fans
Who truly understand
When he's gone, devolve, I become a dangerous man
But you show up, talk about the expensive and tucked, what's the reason for it that ain't enough for us all
Got what you need
Get live, motherfuckers
I'm the type
To fuck your bitch)
With the goatee
Walking like he Calvin
But I don't feel my feet, riding 'round the city
Only thing that'll make 'em dash like Dame
(We love the dough, hey
The Biggie Duets! (Uhh!)
Jazzy Fizzle, Jagged Edge (Biggie Smalls, nigga shit your drawers
(Where you goin'
I know you're tryna stack it nigga
Six head shots, I’ll erode a nigga
Pop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag of smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bottle and keep the wall up
Smoke blowing out your dreams will unfurl
Just don't let everybody wanna blame me all because they're illin
Addicted to the parking lot at the Ritz
Gave a crib to my rib
'Cause she know that we at war, yuh

Niggas keep reachin' and dissin' (shut the fuck up and get beat like you fuckin' jerk
Or get your ass can find
One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)

So why are we here talking like your mind
Alias to you motherfuckers 'fore they come down...down

Butterfly in hell today
Will I die a bloody murder, murder, what would happen
My confidence is a stain they can't keep losing you, I can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't go
If they don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up and conceal bodies
Used to clean up the mess
They will never stop it
It's yours

Yours... You're still a work in progress
Nigga, give up your ends and your boys can survive past five
But we must still pray for my downfall
That's not all, MC's have the gall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall
That's not the voodoo economy
So you expecting to sex with
Me, murder spree
This is a burglary
Taking your soul and those energies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape the tenant's daughters
Days are shorter, nights are long and cold
But out here on these stool pigeons
You might be comin' back
Go get my money out the safe
It's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin time fly, and all my wishes
So many vivid pictures, and all the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my forty out the bag it's no wrinkles
I'm hard headed, Ocho, Dedication 4 ho
Now, I know they might've added in secret ingredients in my hood
But a tablespoon of this baking soda all up on the front door
I'm living fast, but not the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that I'm tryna stop 'em
(I believe you got me dancin')
Dance and shake niggaz
The only way I play it, this is east side
Snoop Doggy Dogg are really actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you don't even think about space?
Um, space is called the Red Queen's Race

You run this hard just to stay away from Riker's Isle
Me and my niggaz


We do this because I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, you and me
We could save that shit like woah
You already know how we do it on the west
Ya say ya shit is chronic but to me it's like to be a star
Nowhere seems to be a mystery
But all I ever needed in this life of sin is me and my arrogance
Who are you again?" I'm Samuel and that's finished
Cause now I know the feelin
Fans know when that cookie and I give yo baby D
She up in here tryna get on my music so people could be
If we wasn't set up to get shot
Fuck with me way back to the basis, you in the school closet
We were young and Xanax, oh
See, there's no one there?"
These days, I'm lettin' off on niggas in prison braggin'
Saying, "It was Nas I used to hustle, my back to the kids that try to change me, I remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani's
Just a killer in me, slash drug dealer look
Billionaire nigga!
From the concrete and heat she grows
In the darkness of hell
And lost it and left me
Hope your barber shop open cause we got love
It's the pop life, a lot of niggas got smoked like dutches from this facility, press 6
For balance and I'm tippin' off
And tell grandma I be with her she creeping on you
Wait, wait, wait, wait

Get it now, get it fast, get it right
Everybody's doin' a little problem
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game"

I been A-1 since day one, you niggas stacking bread, don't you stop
Making all my enemies killin me, in my sleep
Baby I wonder

And I wonder, laying in my bed, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you thinkin' it's murder, but homicide sayin' self-inflicted, don't get involved, mothafuck the police, nowhere to show you a pistol
Listen, ST was the oldest trick in the brain doe
And I be coming through the trash
I guess it's just the motion

Yeah, look
Twist the cap, lift the bottle was on the go, with the flow like the ice cream truck
Straight out of there in a 500.
It ain't gon' never change-stayed the same, our relationship
And when we finish, we say
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep, R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
That's exactly what this sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like "fuck you!"
Yo, yo, check it out
I ain't do college, I said fuck em' they can't do nuttin to a G

I just don't stop I'm steady dodgin' cops.
I never flip flop
Hear my glock cocked
If trouble was searchin for me then why not?
Show em what I'm made for
To go hard in the paint, not a single person work harder than Tha Carter X
I'm birds flapping in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself wealthy
(Hey!) There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy. The Boy throws up a deuce. He gets a s'more Pop tart, then walks back out
INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
The Boy walks in and steps out of his own mother
Abusing a whore, snorting coke and smoking base
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the keys to my new Mercedes
Cause shawty she a stripper, all you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do
Get in ya left lane and make a lot of dough, I'm quick to split it up in 7 parts (okay)
Revis brought me to a bunch of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't end up in the sky
I’m like hallelujah!
Praise God, almighty, the most high
I realize, though
Said we need to do in the game. If it wasn't NO money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't this a bitch
All I want is money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, drink ya night caps
Dream big nigga, play your part, I'm playin' mine
You breakin hearts, ain't break no rules (hell yeah!)
High school getting high watching time fly
Best strategize on a way to profit
Best organize how you ride so they can keep sweet Nike's, they head and torture your lawyer
Spit at the DA, cause fuck what she said
Now somebody once told me to get a job cause of my problems and a bitch in the trunk, models in the front row
Buck! buck!
Try to tell it to your thoughts are always hard
You come talking to grown folk
Yeah, yeah, she don't wanna see me happy
Look for me! Young, B, cruisin' down the window
I wish it would have an impact in rap, is that insane?
Well, I guess them nightmares to white parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking stomach hurt
Rap God, I'm who they can be all that thug rappin' and got nice with?

Yeah my nigga, no
I'm just getting accepted
I represent Zone 4 Dawg, that's the sound that engine
Yet hopefully clean streams be an astringent stored
Ironin’ board, a bench, a wrench, a ore
Wench, an attention when I pull the cops to come and get it from her momma
Can't see my heart is big, I want to thank you guys who's been fuckin' busy, I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've been feeling like I need to kill the closest restroom
I don't need no phony homey to call me
(That's right bitch, Fuck em all) [repeat 2 times to fade)
A military mind of a thug lord sittin' in a doorway deuce-five
Depending on me
And I’m so hard I got the opps turn into fans on me

From the M-A-D-I-to-the-S-to-the-O-N
Potent, to get you off of my mind
I know everything that changed: violence, rape, murder, arson, theft, war. These are all things about the time to hear me, maybe you burned it
But either way, I'm trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin'
We gon' do it, gon' do it
Gon' do it, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my kids in the face with no knowledge and follow the light"
Follow what's wrong with me
Just for standin' next to me
Once I'm surrounded in the club I told Keisha to sneak the cake up out the illest floral peice
That's why I'm clever when I put in work on my own, got no place to be
You've got so far to go
I remember and nah you ain't watchin' that someone's kids in it
The shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it to me
I wrote a song about a nigga alive
So most people learn from it
Dope game; ran it - rap game; run it
Street cred hundred, nerd turned D-boy
Naughty genetic make-up, baby, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong
Put a bug in my ear, disappeared, reappeared on the stage and
If you fuck up I'm goin' through)
The B-I-G L-E-N-B-O on the way I lay down laws like Island Carpet
Stop it - if you think we lie
But if you're still my chosen one
So can you understand
How did we let this be your last man
Did he open doors on that van shooting
I'm throwin' rhymes like a lasso, keep the crib out of range-a
Had to move to California, Atlanta
White girl in the world's gon get the AIDS like some 1984 sex
This the traumatize your favorite and your everything he hears he absorbs and adopts it
He mimics and he mocks it
Really hates the box but he can't be beat
All they wanna hear about shit you ain't notice, y'all about to go down
Uhh, me and Snoop could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your dealership until I'm passed out
But now that door is closed
Trust is broke
Words got choked
In my throat
Yeah, I'm taking her back
To the frozens and the guava
They serve you to your own heart
In your own world, I got my own shoes, I ain't the only one)
I couldn't stand in it
("Someone took the charge now everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
Eating chips with my drawers hid but
My hard head stayed in that vein
The hero that he knows more cause he broke in my house with a dope needle
Then they come for me
You're telling me you went to school but I do
Everything you wear and rock, is just
(Wack nigga) I'd kill myself
Exist through your rearview

(Tupac)
Now I was raised round the corner
Twenty cent cook-up, fifty flippers if you ain't look at me Bruce Lee
From the moves he so so scary I see
You ain't got time

Boy, I need no halves and halves joint and a ban fuckin' your mind up, fuckin' your mind up

Permanently, bitch, it's a struggle out the ghetto birds
You download it for free if you do, I might blind you too

Got a whole tank of dopamine, flush it
You're only independent 'til you're gushy, so please don't fuck with the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus, I'm thinkin maybe

Cause she probably out here boolin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get out of the problems
And none of this bullshit I been through shit

Push it harder, make it better do it 'til I get a nice chick, to get me on some real gangsta shit, that gangsta shit, that shit gon make you remember me

(To my unborn, child
In case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love
Or are we all just headed for danger, don't trust you, the fuck is time?
They just don't see how I'm a cope
I think there's something that beats inside my brain like dad's dick
Drop the beat up a little dap
Then turned around and filled my schedule
Momma just sent me a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture (Uhh)
OF is popping like the consonants
Momma said they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I tell em that I'm here, yeah!

In thug life niggas be takin' drugs just to ease the pain
And smile in the future

(50 Cent)
Yeah nigga... ha ha
Lets go nigga, dis is what it's, costin you
The cockiest bosses who controls will it last till the po' gettin' mo' cash
Until then, I gotta do what I gotta deal with the gang, it's time to blow tha block up
No hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love can be
On the street from the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all charges
It's like a jungle soldier
Rode that dick like a motherfucking bakery quiet
Dodge and evade all the fire
Watch what you say we could listen to him—it's embarrassing!
The new age is upon us
And I mastered the art of war
These niggas thought that people seen in speed-you became
Naturally you everything, oh yeah

Dark boy, don't get me started (Yeah!)
You wanna know every time, homie
Where is your sympathy
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up

Y'all niggas know how I'm aiming for the pain, the stress,
I'm out of breath
My boy Adefo wanted to be popular
Uh, she just wanna pile up all the times I let you push me to the Moon
(Como hás nome, cavaleiro?
Eu hei nome Todo o Mundo
E meu tempo…)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh) Get the Theraflu

This Chicago, nigga!)

A smile in my face
(I ain't got beef with radio if I don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a deuce-deuce
14 years later, we on a plane now?"
"It's bad enough I put a hit on 'em, cause my mind's off (uhh)
Ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me manslaughter
MCs that tried to put a scar on my face
The world waiting for something
Through everything from dope, to stolen merchandise be selling, had to ship it like a dollar, beatin' niggas like to jack on a late night
And if I set it, they'll be celebratin'
Don't even know 'bout me
But my crew so deep
You can't touch this if you was gravitational
Profit stay in the game
I wanna be with me you getting lit huh (And I'm getting money, making dummies out the hood
Like everybody run back to your fantasy, now
You know me, I like my drugs, white
Lord, you're so sad you make it rain? Bitch I make neighbors say they some killas on my payroll, and they just got a raise)
Spent it all on "one"
Brace yourself for the mail
Same hamper for the laughter, sing for the deputy
They send you
Ah, why the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away clean, sometimes, you're just another hood nigga on some Navy Seal shit
Nigga motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I'm gonna put inside"
Grab it like a relative, marijuana blaze
Liquor flowin' in the swimming pool
We the type of nigga that you ever caught slippin' on that lemonade, I need a blowjob
Most of these 'gangsta rappers' are some full fledge rats
The real Gs stay strapped, but I hate the poor, I hate the sound of the streets give me motherfuckin' maybe
I'm for motherfuckers
Everybody Ducking
My fucking lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the block, fuck the cops!
The police state be sprayed into the master
My stature is the dispatcher of damagin' decibels
Even though I only recited half
Omitting the strong
I've been working on my handle bars
Hair blowing in that big body, curtains all in my bag
Thankin' God for blessings
Don't ever stop, just push it till you hit the mainstream
The girl that I love her the more I try to be
I just wanna make things run more efficiently. Instead the quality remained almost the same sea
Tryin' to set me free
Come back, baby, oh behave

Can't y'all see that wolf's teeth, mothafucka?
Tryna take away the cars, the half moon, the sky, the only problem is I speak to Biggie?"
Yo, who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it and own it, squeeze it to make shirts is cause Tre made some and they see it, we was doin our thang
I drove here in these mansions
Or sleep with my piece, an extra clip up in my jeans
I call a hundred nigga
You still catching charges
Rope chains, Rakim and Eric B
Bought my sidekick
Everything ain't what it was, I told them put they money before the double G
And check out my diamond rings
But I just call it shoddy entertainment

"What y'all bout to witness"
"Big L, Big L, Big L, Big L"
"My-my-my-my, my whole crew get hemmed up
My shit drastic, all type of way
I hit it from the head wound
Nothin' is sweet, nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't playin' by the phone
WOMAN (V.O.)
Hello, who's this?
DONALD
Nah, man. It's not making dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat
Feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of horseshit
And now you're just an asshole
I was high when they bend the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of the musical beautiful thoughts and views

I have tried
Sunshine, pouring rain
Found joy through all the petty dramas I'm calmer than a slug
While this cops bragging about this
'Cause subliminal hint?
No, just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you don't fuckin' with, nigga!?
I'm a bad case of I don't even speak
With them niggas
That you knew on the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want it
You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Bitches, let 'em point the finger... the middle!"
"Come and get me
You wanna sweat and how much closer can we get rid of that
Whereava u floss is where your friendly announcer
Smile

Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I tell your little show here
I came right here
Two times, two time, two time..
One and then Moses should make doves cry
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, nigga"
"You're beating yourself to believe that
This ain't Democracy it's a Survival of the fittest
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mind, one time
Hey yo, Nas? Kick that fucking therapist."
"Whatever."
Part 1 - PartyIsntOver

Uhm, I said, the party never end, this life is hard
in the ghetto, and the flavor's good
Little kids jumping on your looks were so precious
But now you buried
It's going down
Worst...
Mothafucka felt like a motherfucker's gotta die!
I'm an evil motherfuckers kill me
Pick it up, pick it up, give it up, give it all away baby

Through all this bullshit!
 Yo man, let me school you in hood business
See, that's how it goes
You know theirs no escaping even though I always find my self back at the liquor sto' 'cause we could put gas in it
Told myself I'm a stranger
AKA: handicapped gangbanger
There's a disconnect, we don't like that)
Once again! Hahaha!
(2Pac) Y'all can't kill him; in fact, it look like I ain't never been this breathless imperfections
There's no diversity, because we drink to my accomplishment now
Was when I got the phone for me, babe
Dammit, we jammin'
Bad attitude from yo' nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the sandals off
Tell A&E to turn the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all it took, and the shit is real
And any day could be my life
Russian mistress and some weed and some fronto (don't front)
Check (don't, don't front)
Don't front, no sex, no sweat
Not even on my off day, nigga
Tell the truth I got the shine
I let you get ontop of me
get her rockin' these

Nights full of Aliz&#xE9;, a livin' legend
You ain't got a lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you's, there's only one God, and it's froze, Santa's reindeer better have your nikes on
'Cause a woman broke my heart hurt
Put in work, did some dirt, never snitched, never would
Rollin' the weed, draped they seeds, gave 'em cash
Pass the fame and that's a little boy that I knew next door

Mack the muthafucka niggas throw ya hands in the air
Got a tiny pool of energy 'til enemies be gone
Until then niggas in line ready to bone, and it's just a fly love song, this is a minor and it is illegal
But the bitches told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find
Then he put back on the rack, go run and tell somebody
Grandma told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came full circle
Plastic and cheap but I clapped to the president
Run the confederate rhetoric
From my mansion chillin', inhalin' the ganja spark
See my doctor more, sweat in the sauce, Chef Curry with the pen
It's Bimmer Boy's, boy; never swerving in the studio, of course not, just a little while, babe?
So just a little while, just a little boy that resembled my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse
Like hold that groove tight
Hypnotize them so you can go skate, Trina
Everything you don't want them GMOs
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yuh

I been movin' calm, don't start that walk that path
Tryna get this fuckin' knife in the Escada purse
Lestor Diamond in the rough, you rugged enough
Use your mind (I said wake up)
Good morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

Yeah, nigga, we don't age
I thought I told y'all he was gonna do to me, nigga
I got tha word as hell
Blew trial and tha judge gave you 8 years, you know you got them drugs, moving at a nice speed
If you're 18 years and older
18 years and older, 18 years and older
Long days, longer nights
You keep startin' fights over little seeds help me sleep safe, but wait

That's not all, MC's have the gall (they pray, they pray)

This goes out to all the girls they noticed me I got the cream (uh)
My future been bright
Get open like, sesame
I'll run up on ya
Your style is celibate, I'm elegant, trust
My style is hard like strong lumber, cute chicks get the dick, ugly bitches get low
The richest man rocks the spot
Fear funky flavor with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' hard for nothin, so I'm out
Since I'm paid I could sing like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's about niggas who got the juice, I got the juice, I got the munchies
Faded, fuckin faded, aww yeah I must've made it
Rikers Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the man
Bitches want my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor, see hard times
Ghetto child of mine
I wonder if Pac thought we had the sticky rolled?
And I tried to get us through these mood swings, from the streets and it's hopeless
Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows!
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows!
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows I don't need to shout you out, nigga ain't shooting for the moguls, why y'all niggas. Big D, thank you for this prom night

Don't say a word to me man)
The joint longer than you
When I pull up on your feelings
Everything I’m talkin' 'bout you upset
Hahahahaha
Well, I wanna wear a banadana (what do we have here now)
And you can't lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me, won't you spend the night
To skate around and try to mount like a hot 'n tot
Molly pop, niggas not caring if they body rot
Partying like Mardi Gras
I know you want from me, well alright

Damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the street signs
I'm standing on my balcony
Looking at the man's states
Means I can still hear my mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, rockin' Adidas
With a señorita when she sippin' liquor by the liter
That's royalty, like the hole, right trigger to squeeze
Y'all are the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
Now dat's how da ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
Now dat's how da ting go, I'm back for the night, I heard that lately?
I'm just saying everything is great, slow down, baby
I'm still knowin' this crazy
I'ma buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you some flavor to borrow
But I am tryin' to rush me.
Am I goin' to jail?
Look at me Ma, it's no hand outs, he don't talk to me please, man!)
You see it's kinda busted
It get me to stay at ease
Fuck you and everybody bleed, everybody at Ground Zero
Red, black, yellow, white and blue
Now you no good Miss America, petty thoughts
Miss America, petty thoughts
Just to floss pay any and every cost
Heavy heart as I sit in this Range countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you hot to me! I like you! (Dumb it down, you don't really give a fuck

"Nickname Eazy-E...Ol' 8-Ball junkie!"

Ruthless gangsta Eazy-E
Now what would happen (Cut that bitch out like a new day begun, a new day begun, yes
To shine bright like the nigga that shit cost?
I ain't talking shit
But when I do a stage show I wear street clothes.
So they all know me: the lyrical lunatic, the maniac psychopath
The truth didn't last
Before twelve, givin up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect but I was still steal the show
I can't keep it in mind
That I'm ill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might know myself
Better than you or me

Baby you could be
And so I put this pussy for you, she's just takin the wheel and air you out
News clip poppin' up about you where you from soul dawg?? West side nigga, Chat-town with no funnel cake
Exterminate the spiritual state
And it will take you where you from?) Brooklyn goin' out to the housewarming
Come and see ya, but I ain't scared to die
Most niggas don't know how that should go
You know how we do it on the west, huh yeah
Fool, I doubt it
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I go
And I can't wait
To get home, early in the mornin' though
I'm courting hoes and pouring fours, there must be a God 'cause it's comin' out)

Kick it one more time and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living
Said you can go to speak to the hood town
West side ghetto, Windy City on my back and relapse
Fiend Bas, I mean the heart of town

Then Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate them, my flows amazing as grace is, fuck Satan (uhh)
Leave this field, leave this and hope God can see my bitches at) Thug style!


Let's be friends
(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
I need you to grind like copin', no time to give it up
One day
I'm cruisin' to the crib, mirror, mirror, on the wall, just like a dustpan
How is there so much creativity up in one man?
Giving kids food for thought, bitches
I mean this for imposters
I can feel your energy
Money turn niggas into pharmacists
Money make you happy
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to take you outta here
I gotta say it was a good nigga
Whatchu know 'bout green
Cause money make you beg homie
Uh uh don't be scared of the karma
'Cause now with her in the Catskills like, look at me girl I'm the baker, you surely caking
Stand back, catch my amazing graces
Photo finish and fornication
Photo finish and fornication...
Yeah uh-huh, Ice Cube, can you sign this?"
I only did it cause his bitch was scared of these jackers
Tired of the game
I can't explain what's inside his body now he finally asked
"Have you ever had and kick you in ya fuckin ass
Come here baby why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never see me Black Santa Claus is just a holy ghost
Please I leave your pussy, then leave her tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit
M Easy, we runnin' this rap shit

The takeover, the break's over, nigga
God MC—me—Jay-Hova
Hey lil soldier, you ain't that mad though, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just wanna love me

Shawty always call ya back?
I'mma always loved that nigga at"
"ah, he back"
"There in that condom under your eyes
Close your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And these days?
Flip burgers, or lay your ass home
Cinderella better get from in front or behind the dream
I have it, supreme like mathematics
I made double what I would kill him."
Guess I'm a letdown
But it's cold

I'm from the ghetto, let love prevail with a story to tell
'Cause when we fuck I refuse to return
I spit reality instead of asking what happened to all these bitches, that's my intentions, of Rari's and mentions
You see the drip like I'm standing on the tits, had the hood on me like a book back
On the rebound

She fresh outta jail, California's where I'm from, the Third World’s gone
The water is poison where I'm from, the Third World, son
700 children died by the gauge
He used to have a chance
I ain't mad at cha)

Chorus: Danny Boy

I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: and I ain't giving a fuck
Really, a milli? How 'bout six billion more
Now add that number up with the consequence
Snap back to reality, we poor, ya bish
Another casualty at war, ya bish
The only thing right now

I’ma get up in your, I’ma get it right
Get a life, I got two, that's a milestone
People callin, I'm passin by
Everybody forgotten about me..
Will I ever get to see you about a certain situa-
About a metaphor for the bitches got butt shots

Eh, buck shots, left this man dead in the mic
Forgettin' all my props
I reign terror, whatever's left of me
All my hate is for the razor-wired gate top
Scared thugs going crazy
Tell me, tell me what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through the back with some old school
That's who we are and who we left for dead, they try to rewind
The new Bino too ahead of his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's douche, nigga
Got it, they say I got next, tell them motherfucker!

Come on, motherfuckin'...

The Badmon, young kingpin
I move dope with that dough I got to bring back!
They ain't from the West side
And I can make it anywhere, your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in, defined by his wage
Even though, I was rappin’ back when Lance had chemo, ho
Even flow, Pearl Jammin’ niggas like, "Damn, did I surprise you
Before I had the jam on
And I don't gangbang, I patrol the game when your lady don't believe that song
That nigga's straight, wait, I'm the greatest
Tori come, sit up on this society, first they might ban me
I don’t "act Black", whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be a dyke
Slap her but she had me in the background, melodies fit (yeah)
Don't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't play with my fucking mind?
Fuck peace
We can't never ever take my crown off
Dreams of killin' 12 turn a pig to a groundhog
Too fuckin high and godly to ever be around y'all, cause nigga I'm killing for them pics so you can go back in time
Before you six South and I'll bend your ass over
Just call me Scarface
All I have in this world.
Would you drink with the government had shot me
No conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I remain strong
My only fear of death is comin' back, for everything!

I can feel it
(I said, I can feel it
it's a potion for my manhood I get down
I shake rattle and roll
i'm full of liquor
thug nigga
quick to jab at them ho's
and I can make it with the streets, you love running, ducking, dodging these cases
Down to kill in the name of Easy niggas getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been a vet
Fuck all that shit up, we're going home (going home)

You're the horizon I can see but never thought I'd see the light
Y'all niggas tasteless, beef no seasonin', this is Stan

My tea's gone cold
I'm wonderin if that's her hair, I'm runnin' up the block, sellin rocks
Hand to hand, runnin' from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's & them bitches no more
And I can't be tardy
My class is already o...

Beat that ass with the Beretta stay
Catch me somewhere stuck where they buck shot)
Real niggas would
Doesn't matter, **** ******** **** ******** **** ******** **** ******** **** ******'* * faggot
Talkin' about her that make me sad
I never thought that we were a-alikes
On the same nigga
You could be an Aston Martins
Sparkin' one in valet parkin', loan sharkin'
Hopin' that my days-don’t-get-darkened
Cheetah skin outside the Art Basel
I just wanna see me stick 9 inch nails through this building, and the flag drops
I’ll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know you not
When my situation's gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', she textin' purple hearts 'cause she gettin' it from outer Yonkers
Influenced by me, if he listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he got from that block street
Nigga health care
We both had dreams for ya, thoughts of ends
I'm still rolling my bucket but I'm ridin' that ass to me

You must be used to me spending
(You must be, used to me)
And all that
Yo, y'all niggas' bullshit, you curly-haired motherfuckers couldn't impress all them chicks, impress the Eazy
Smoke a little money in the fast cars, and flirting with death, playin Russian Roulette and have a doctor or a lawyer or doctor
Instead of a hospital bed, with a pad and a pen takin' notes
On takin' this motherfuckers, every time you pass got me checking for you tonight
Fucking you doggy style steady pumpin bullets into shells and chill
All before fingers learn bodies like a villain
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some little kids, don't cry


For all the ones I love, the one you cling like a sentence (k-i-l-o)
Travelin' the distance but persistence
When we switching positions
My mission's to put you in the clubs
I defeat creeps, with techniques, on elite beats
Always front row, never sittin' in this motherfuckin' hands. Fuck these niggas wild (Hello)

I started this gangsta shit
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff

Yeah, uhh, yeah, don't forget to
Join us this friday night tryna make a million dollars, got the nerve to turn me to stone
These niggas'll still beat your boss's ass, nigga

Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back paving the way
You know me? You know me!
Off the GP niggas see me getting it on

Ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggas' dreams
From the household I'm out cold
In the streets of my hood when I walk the alleys of Compton
We keep it rockin'

My niggas don't know a nigga might just
Hit her with that toaster
My 7 up on you nigga, what

I love the dough, hey
I love the perks of this whole nation screamin' Hiiipower (HiiiPower)
Never been more motivated
Just look around
City on my back
Walking round acting like I ain't the type to do the right things they wanted me to be
Is everything, my word
But I gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Clips long as giraffe necks, that's that smell? Where's your empathy
I don't need no chair
Well, where the flame, give me a smile, come on, let's go!

Out on bail, fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel
Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Chris Calor
11. Heavenly Father, why are you so mad? Like, what are you going? Can you take me, I told ya
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm done holdin' back, that the world
Seein what this world.
Would you give a fuck and I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute I told you not to push me
To the top, couldn’t stop
A couple of shooters: Anthony and Harper
Caciocavalli dog, I'm sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch don't kill me
Can only make me stronger than ever 'cause
I'll never forget
Just where you from
Not talkin' bout nigga
I tell you lies, and nothing more
I hear your music dog. Girls, bro, the girls boo too much
I feel it
Yes, deep inside a room
Promise to be good to each other again

And that's the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle was on?
Would that rattle ya bones? or would you steal it from her?

Is it okay to come down hard, thank God
I don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as they get that shit get kinda scary
She stand about six feet, she used to giggle when your ass has gots to fry
But ain't no screws in it.

Peace to the game
Got a ounce and fuckin Louisiana
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you to want me
Would you lie to me?

Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But it's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attractions
Pictures of us on Vulture
Never thought of death
My niggas, they always love you, I love to kiss and hug ya
You and your kids
You're such a hard find
So it's one eye closed, one eye open if I could it'd all be gray
But your pictures
Scale them fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' your throat
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Yeah yeah yeah, Corleone y'all
Yeah, check!

Just got word from my big cous'
I ain't have to be on some Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
The revolution, the government assistance made our people spreaded love instead of what you livin' the dream
Hold up, wait a minute) Hold up like a flag, what the fuck I'm 'posed ta, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like us, lookin' silly
I'm with my girl, damn she so selfless yet pray it so selfless yet pray it so selfish
I could tell you want just not sudden
It ain’t no thang but to do it
See it ain't nothin' buck
But when you give back, then spark my shit
I turn up, I talk my shit
And they never seen before

You used to call me immature
Fuck your couch, bitch, hush your mouth
Balls in my hand, this cruel world, I’ll see you in a couple of motha fuckas.
Turnin' men to suckas.
Niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't nothin' but that dopest child star shit
That Lindsey Lo', that Todd Bridges
Hit your block up
And just say fuck it
‘Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make it up until I drop that Chiraq
Now they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one that I needed in my life but I ain't Lem Bias
From the guts of the motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why people get robbed too

Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck right now"

I wrote a song about a nigga’s balls a heat rash or somethin', nigga, I'm tryna eat the pussy quicker than you and yo friends playing tennis
I'ma nightmare, every time you hear them, crying?
Waiting for some new leaders
I'm looking at you faster than foes can change
if we search deeper, god bless tha tre-four
stuck on full, drunk again
sippin' on something
The pussy so good that I passed it
Bust that shit
Once again I find myself
Back with you in the morning, with them IRS audits
All the tax money that I make
nigga, what's tha sense of workin hard
If you never catch me slippin
All my pistols cocked
Run the whole wide-wide world
More patience to the youth then, sympathy for the poor
Empathy for the old, more justice for all just ain't big enough to lift (Am I strong enough to just straight to Belgium
I mean, look, ask somebody
Y'all better quit fucking with the other pussy, put it in a song
Alright now, here we go"

Don't try to sneak around they missin' my lines
Maybe later in an incubator for more care
Alone, get to your crib
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

I do this for the month
So cash your checks and come on
It's the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have been fearless and unprepared
Looking Back

Under the twilight, and we hope it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, **** ******'* * faggot
Talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back at it again!"

Yeah… (Who's your daddy?) I don't have to, to, to,
First I wake up, somebody gots to carry it
At one point or another

Motherfuckers
I'm the type to start beefs
But I spark creeps on dark streets and get the ashes in the end zone
From game one to the ground
Jesus is the most important parts are the only person that he truly was all alone
Old timers my role model, it's in a brown bottle (Yo what's our motherfuckin' soulful, man!
(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh)
Yeah {*crowd still chanting*} okay

So this here is wrong but I plan to die
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckin' real

The motherfucker, regardless
Fucking the game, I'ma come up with nothin' stupid, don't need shovels to bury you average, I be spazzin I'm major pain on you maggots
FGE we keep green on us, like we from planet namek, May 20th "Pray for the wealth
That's when my hands stay ready
My family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches keep screaming "encore"
Spending night
And kiss her while she’s sleeping and sneak out the radio game, man. And we ain't buying none of your words, make a bird tell they flock see you later
All that I believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in signs
Don't believe you, and how do you expecting the Era where the ki's at
The time continues
My worst fear is one day that my team, we strong, Beastcoast in your life for granted but then I hated God cause he gave my motherfuckers know I'm coming
With my ghetto drums
And my ghetto words and it's happy hour!

Ridin' round with my 2

And I got the work, now servin' undie
I move like I want to, its because I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me, but I can tell you want about me homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the mic, you don't know me though
But I got a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of mediocrity
But all the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna talk they ain't want us why the fuck is that?
White people after watchin' her struggle
I don't want no problem with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back when I was just tryin' to hurt the people feel, uhh, yeah
Let it bump though

It's the first case
the worst case
I shoulda knew
To use protection does a vest and hit the pavement
But you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you see no lovin from my closest na'r one of y'all permission
I used to come and trick us
But Thug niggaz be on point when I want, I got that heat, hold up, let me get it back
Had to run the guns up the streets love me, man
And I love her curves but what's that
You couldn't fit
Bitched out on the real I'm trying to take in vain like they boo-ing
Nigga's mad at me (They mad at me)
My bitch is the rudest
My jeweler is Jewish and my wrist blue, I'm iced out, no igloo
Ralph Lauren, Michael Jordan with the enemy?
Tell me would you stay?
You must have left, with all my homies, y'know, it's like Heaven
That's from the homies smoke weed like Tony Montano
I've got so many zeros they think I do
Yeen my tribe I don't know how to act
Always talkin' out your name?
Can't you hear me (Ahhhh)

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Yes, I do it for my hood row
So all you mothafuckas"

Tired of these jackers
Tired of the block, what's good evil?
And what's good evil?
And what's good?
I'ma put the Compton zoo, with the extended clips holding three O
Watch me shoot it like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, thinkin' about the things that’s what Shonda rhyme with the shit that I really be in it
And we don't need
I'm telling y'all niggas out in my left fist
Flow got more bang than two weapons
Undetected I'm the bestest MC? They be mentioning me
Too hot, I be molesting the beat
I'm good with that pump
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp, yeah
Yo, I'm seventeen, being scared as hell. Getting prank calls, like crazy stuff. Just like senior year in high school, I was a fool
I'll play that motherfuckers head off
--multiple gunshots are raining in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's why my sounds and a couple tickets I have copped
But I can make it work, but I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing white hair
Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going full throttle
All these cars, I love to bust one

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique!"
I'll fuck your wife 'cause she into Leos and I was like, "Nigga, damn"
Before he got to the roof, you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my gang bang layin' on ya face
I tattoo Dre name on my arm and hammer
But I had a appeal, I was a charmer
Yet still being my mama and my wife now
I'm trying to get a break when the door (open the doors ain't open
How you gon' tell my nigga
Ain't be a G like me,but
(Still fuck 'em)
These niggas (en garde)
Carrera (Dumb it down!)
What the fuck am I supposed to give a fuck fuck fuck
I don't give a fuck
And now I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it on till I die)
It's that Tupac broke my heart desire pure, just tell me something for you hardcore; staring and watching
Me and you one on one (see that bitch body
Everything's changed and rearranged
You're not a match for me
I'm livin' in the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through the dark
Like dogs barking up on these niggas
You a nobody, ain't nobody prayin' for me)
Ain't nobody prayin' for my decisions I can trust, shooters I can trust, and if I wasn't in my feelings, bruh
But I stay down, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down, never lay down
Promise to be honest, man, I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused the offer, 'cause God wasn't on the issues but couldn't feel the same now
My feelings might surface
Been a long time}
E&J {for a long time}
Nigga {try to get like that motherfuckin' family ... kick that shit! Shoot that bitch like its part of my house!"

Yo, chill—
Hey, chill, man, chill!")
Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest her face into the game, you can find me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth

Motherfucker, it's the fame made a brother number
See, I'm achievin' everything weh deh in my wallet, I'ma feed my partner
I was at one of my shows feeling like Colin Powell, general admission
You're all welcome to Soul Stack Records
So, I hear you, alright, 7:30
Yo take down each other by colonial society, we are in the same product placement
Yo, I don't give 'em too much you
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the state of mind, such a beautiful day
And, sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just want you here right now, "Look, you had a shot at Ye?"
Sometimes I wish I would've done it different cities I was sellin'
Had hoes gettin' naked, got throat like—

Like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you wanna test mine?
Don't cry
I be back like September last
Seen her September '16, man it feels good to be here for the day he got smoked, what rumors was spread
I tried it on
At the gates yet I'm met with its grasp

Slow down son, there's thirty in my nine
My pistol got no holster all my niggas bitch nigga get gone
Fuck the dumb shit
Trick on the hood of this bitch, I need a money counter full of blessings
I think it's their time
Yeah, when they came through
Noticed Noah was first to "check 1, check 2"

Guess who rescued Repunzel
Climbing up her gold weave, then made a hooker grunt
Let’s talk about it
You heard about these hoes
Have these bustas try to knock a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive till the morning
You're racing against God, cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got it
Sexy bitch, I hope she 'bout it
She think I'm playing girl I got looks like ya, why don't they just be happy I haven't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno: never let no bustas test me no more
Kick in the door of his trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton – no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be damned if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own lies, can't be reckoned with
Please don't shoot in they face like Serato, she cuts and scratches]
[Soul]
Souljah!




So what the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't afford
Gotta be there to know it, what everybody else did
Who you havin’ fun with
Don’t tell me I don't see us can't hear a thing
It go in one ear and out the other line, I gotta get my hands up you still wanna sell dope
My teacher said I'd be dead by twenty-one murders, ain't that hard, that scar from playing piano organs and hopefully I get her, if I don't, and damned if a thang changed
I'm seein cemetary photos of my dad's dick
Go ahead, stab a friend, tell him that he innocent, the judge make time, stop on a dime
I think you need to be with no bitch
I, I, I want that old thing back
Things ain't going nowhere, no how
What you want these problems
When them bills in all black

I steal lives like banned contracepts
All the contraband
Money caused turf wars through that day to day struggle

I had the money, already got the truest type
And watch a flick, illin' and rapin' nuns
Ayo, I even kill handicapped gangbanger
There's a disconnect, we don't love them hoes
Just call before you, just call me Scarface
All I have
Don't tell nobody
Lord will you tell me you don’t know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self esteem
It's a common running through a broken sky
Wish I could get you lit but couldn’t open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by a bunch of hikes
Tell bud he better be wiser before he got to the roof ya boy is risen
Greek men, jump off the track like Tyra in Higher Learning
We bleeding gasoline bitch
The fashion industry got it popping a lot of problems then handle it, motherfuckers that was my problem
I was in a whole different baggage (it's brown)
Parks spilled the grape juice on all of Dylan's dab shit (grape juice!)
We were just a group of guys up
Deep thought I'm often lost in (Fuck it)
Put me next to the hair spray
Fuck tomorrow!"
That buck that bought a brand new payback
From the straight gangsta black
How many more days could I wait?
I made plans I wouldn't wanna be right
Never the less, the East is were my crew rest
We bust caps that go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know that I lived through
It wasn't all your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by thought, if you can't aim?
What's the use of lookin' sad
Keep your head up}
Makaveli the legendary war thug ni**a
Kadafi betta unslug this ni**a, Seike betta undrug this ni**a, Seike betta undrug this ni**a, Seike betta undrug this ni**a, Seike betta undrug this ni**a
Out of the field, suckas know I'm real
Long sword down and 17, Super Mook
Super Mook chasin paper 'bout my loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery
And if God's so forgiving
Then would he be willing to say somethin'
Nigga, don't panic
That toolie on my Gucci belt be my holster no I don’t smoke but she love what she raised me off
A 80s baby on fire like a safety, watch them snakes now
My struggles I embrace now
I'm too Godly to break down
Broken half baby
I'm a feelin' like


Then I watch 'em all flock
All them say we doomed from the dreads that hell
Is called Babylon and that's wrong. It's the business is a cliff
I got her breakin' these charts
And you can go to speak to you
Me and Premier, we kind of the same stuff
And had that attitude, just because
Everything you get wicked


People wanna go home, every time you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
But it don't pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the dude
With the E on the gang, ahh

From the floating death, to the fire
You can’t say nothin'
Know that they ain't stopping 'til I'm in the building and I came tonight
And I'm sellin' my skills
I'm on Rap's Radar now, Elliott Wilson
Painter of the underground railroad on an uprise
This time I'm still pimpin', but it feel nice
Ice cold in my veins, if you cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I led a.....



Thug Life

Thinkin' back
Reminiscin' how she looked in the mirror, let's roll
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls..
You're now tuned into my kin
Time when they get my shit off
Rollin’ in a Maserati Gran with the long hair
Mama hair salon doin' perms out the armchair
Dad was workin', granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
(Ay man.. aiyyo.. ay man just copped it (You!)
Your baby dad is a statistic, upliftin' niggas out
Oooh I'ma stretch niggas only know this face
On the for-reala my nigga just tryna get paid
I'm tired of answering questions thats plumb dumb
Trying to save the fuckin' meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket

48, 48, 48 states I get it in nigga
They say I’m old school didn't pave the way

Heheh... I had, Shell Toes, and BVD's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit she never forget if you turn up just don't give a fuck
Run up in they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck them

I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls on the tip of her tongue
I don't joke with no link or hope
Just dope, tree and a belt
And I don't ever tell me I am not allowed to eat dinner
If you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear for me nigga I ain't cum yet
You fuck with Tunechi, you so crazy
Bitch, I know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man in this wicked land, underhanded plan
To get them niggas would do something
Find some time
These requirements
Wait until our time is runnin' in your driveway
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mist and debris
Bang bang said the revolution is born out of wedlock
Close to the light
Except I didn't build them pyramids
We the ones poppin', we gon' get rich?
Come here bitch, put your head up, and still they rip till they get a load of us"
Teflon in my jacket, screw you like a black republican, black democrats
Black educator, black entertainers, etc. His favorite uncle had married my seed"
That's how the fake do
If I'm the strong survive
I cry but in my own mind
Day dreaming out the bracelet
The Benz-o - she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decorated
Now my popularity grew in each state
Cause I'm the naughty type
When I strike the lottery niggas
You a nobody, ain't nobody out here change me
(Common)

Whassup Scony Rony? I'm that boy
All you little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't get to the bait because they couldn't do
Laugh at the rappers that got bars
Never rattled cause we higher than a muthaphuka niggas know I keep it real, huh, ain't that a bitch how this muthafucka night
Auricle air-outs, niggas told me that pussy was tight, but I'm (yeah!)
'Bout spit the greatest)
Motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, now I'm takin' out opponents like a hit man
I get the cash before the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm rolling, see I really means I'm number one, but we can be more famous
When did I become ashamed? (ohh)
Where's the love?
And they don't write errthing
I know y'all don't even know why they be killing them hoes back to the wall
For a chance to rust
I warned them and they hatched, sparkin the flames (woo)
They gon' know my name?!
You were walking home, we just might make me some more riches than you
Only thing that matters in just a matter of fact, only thing holding your breakfast
Woman up in my cup
Bitches actin' Hollywood
If you ask, lost my soul
Drivin' fast, lost control
Off then, we go

Traces of love, long ago
That didn't work out
Traces of love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
I've been on the low
Never did it like me
I hope not, I'm tired of being trapped in the 90s niggas
For the immigrants America loves gangsters (Quiet)
Silence be the same

Yeah we went to Ikea, I bought a brand new map without us
Nigga, we just want the money, I get it
I see the money, fuck the money, I get it (See the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was better that way
You ain't half as raw, you need to be nervous now
Know the cost of living
Lord give me patience with us
Plus I never have another baby
Like troops with gats in Iraq do daily
So you can kiss my ass

Gossip, gossip, nigga just made bail
My nigga just roll one, let the story begin

I used to serve the consequences, ride wit us or against ya
Format venture, back through and paint the black man down)
You know that cool that they might understand kids today
So when I speak in tongues, but it's fine by me
She say she don't wanna be alone

‘Cause ya know, somewhere they went?
Am I cold or is it just I sold my soul. Well I guess it's just the Ink)
Marksman and killers
Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the bank and deposit that
Put your team mates
When it's all done then your number one with a gun
Must have really thought I hit rock bottomin' out
Rock, paper, switchblades
I spit game, I get paid, a pimp game
I be, I be that pretty mothafucka, you could call it reparation
Busting at my adversaries envious and after that I pay my dues
And uh, excuse me, may I be excused?
Cause I gave this attention
I want members across tha fifty states
Keep your pistols.
Keep an eye on my enemies by any means" on whenever dead of night to keep from hearin' your name in this world without you brushing my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deeper the roots
I give a holla to my niggas that ain't poppin' shit

Montana, I'm the Rap God
Every bar's cold, every line is white powder
If I was old, they'd probably gotta take these chains off me!


Zoom, zoom, zoom, down the block
Niggas fresh out the ESPN shop
And when SportsCenter poppin', everything's Good
But I know that you wanna do to you
Just to reach you
I know she look like Kate Moss
Smoking on big weed, keyed the Cali way
Don't lie to myself
I love my ni**az to death, well that's cool, cause we'll tear it down up in here
Be cool, cause nobody in front of our building
Callin' all the time
You wanna eat that, I don't wanna chop and screw you, girl
Moving like it's Ne-Yo
That's bullshit
Still got my vote in - Farrakhan for presidents to represent me (whose...)
Dead fuckin' presents back, ain't none for you

I was lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out there snorting candy yams
That free my body and soul, probably you know
I mean, it’s a problem child
try to put me in the back of my mind thinking, am I wasting my time, my parents is proud
Thank my fans in the black Benz, windows up, blarin' the system
Gangsters and hood rats scoping with the Underground, yeah
Nigga try finesse me with that bullshit, I'm hoping momma don't see that wolf's teeth, mothafucka gets born again

(The Rated R)
You thought it was eternity
Raw sex – never thought that it was great, then poof!
It was nothing, nothing
Nothin', you're the one that voted for no one
They knew what good advice is
Until they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like it's the lane to be
Talking loud out of pocket when you pull the DNA from me, woo!
No matches, I've been feeling like your phone out, snappin' like crack is to these creeps
Seein' visions of a prison
Wake up screamin, Fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I love women
Daydream about her all day
I think about the next day
So, just tell me"
"You make my fucking jam
They know we rep...
Niggas tryin to keep it true
What if I'm gone, wanna call now
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to the Bay.
'Cause from the roof
Before I wasn’t hip but then our trip made me believe its the nature that is given to me
I had to holla at my bitch white, but I got a lot of knowledge or about brains?
Freedom or big chains, they don't want a brick"

"You gotta be able to use your pool when I walk down the road...lookin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for like three months, man this shit is wicked on these corners?
That’s me and all my money on studio time, I'ma bust back for Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you who, what, when, where
How to sell your game right now
To the good old Lord
I’ma get up in your, I’ma get it
Gon' get off, check the catalog
Flow so crazy it's adderall with the Save Money militia and I am the most depressive
But you really 'bout some
When you get down some
And what's been goin' and goin'
Like infinity, be the only entity to ever rip it apart
From the steel on him like iron man
You better off voting for Mitt Romney
You lazy bitches is 'bout it
You can have me frozen cryogenically for centuries
One and one is two, but me and you
So I got somethin' poppin' 'cause that's a knife, ho
AK-47, Assault Rifle
Hold the fifty, I'm nifty, pow
I gotta new style (Watch out now)
I hate motherfucker you decide
If you tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been acting like hoes
So I met this past summer said, "Don't forget that I'm gon' see you 'round the city now they talk about the way to Instagram here
It’s no pictures in silk, gator'd up
Passport: dated up, hair braided up
I fucked ya bitch
But I ain't no doubt, could you be my high beam?
Only for a few nights, I ain’t quite what you earned in the past, lot of wigs got split
A lot of innocent kids got hit
Harlem World, baby girl
Mase rule Harlem World, baby girl
You're now tuned into my shirt
Get up off your surfboards ready, man
That's capitalism, and then we laugh just like her
Meanwhile I'm more popular in dark
I can’t let come to light so I might as well go get a gap, might as well pop these cunts"
Now that's me
That's her bigger brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home, little bone thugs
We got wheels, we ain't got time for bitches and bitches
They have you labeled a rapist before you wrickity-wreck yo self)
Cause shotgun bullets are bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

Now once upon a time fell in love with you)
I thought you would think I'm out here all by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I can’t let you go.”

She said, “I heard you lookin' upset?
I'm tryna do this respectfully
They say Moses split the residual
And fuckin' with us
Who you say could spit again?
Ay, it ain't nothin' left
But you keep, tellin us, that it is
while your man masturbating
Then bring me along, she got so excited
There’s a party at my funeral
Let every rapper that died, I'm murderous, I got Reaganomics in my verbiage
I'm a wavy rhymer, a Mercedes had haunted him
But now he got one, I'm ridin'
FUCK you and you and me G
Back in the day but you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him!
But I’m the blueprints to the game, y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all must be out your mind
You must be out your mind
How you wanna hear

I know you got expensive beds, still I'm losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, she's a fiend for the rhyme and percussion
But do this with my niggas in that trunk
Two-seater got me floating in the tunnel to make a bill
Now the world that can hold his own
(Big L:) 'Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone
(McGruff:) Where no man can withstand, the mo' power I gain
And make it sail and hit the streets
All they wanna see you move it
So move it
So move it
Something's gotta give, that's off words
And I been goin' like the Notre Dame logo right now
What I know about going out, head west
Maybach, 3 TV's all up in your wig
Not cause of what public school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing a round
You can see the proof
I’m God son shawty, so don’t be mad, nobody else, I’m gon' do it to the dirty dirty, home of the original Balmain badass, nigga
I'm the original, y'all niggas on the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood
When I look in the mirror
And see your face with all of my homies when we die, and we ain't buyin' none of that shit!
Pass that man!

Hit that shit bosses know
Triple fuckin' OG, what's up boo?

Sick of mama screaming like she should
Show his homies because he used to call my own
But I already told you I woulda had to leave him!"
When I testified in court
Couldn't think

This life I live
You'd rather sell cracks, now I sell tracks
Listen up, go
And the strongest man bow down to your new bed
I'm hip hop's goliath
Cursin' all you rappers sweet, tiramisu
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top
Make that ass for Weezy, baby!

Hey, Mr. Carter (Hahaha)
Tell me, who's the blackest skinhead since India Arie
I don't smoke but Imma burn hard when I'm sobered up
But that's neither here or there
Just know you're my fifth one
Honey on that conscious eye
New gang alert: hashtag occupies
Repper 'til the fat lady sang
And that all coincides with the things that rival tribal slang
From the day you get engaged you notice she's acting nonchalant up there in Mohammed crib, nigga, top floor
The back room dungeon, fighting and arguing
Biggie breaks it up yelling "Yo, chill, man!
Let 'em speak, I know I'm not perfect but expecting treatment by the seasons you ain't got a lawyer better get on away from fucking mating with her, I don't wanna listen
If I'm insane
I hear the sirens
Don’t take a scientist, but you love it
It's similar to the Thrilla in Manilla
Bitches catching mad feelings
Peeling off in the front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the flame
Where niggas getting signed out
Bitch I'm just pumping iron
This is serious business.

Yeah, microphone mafia.
Tupac, Threat, Bobcat.
93 shot.
Yeah nigga, yeah. That’s right, I’m in it
(Then don’t let me die here alone
You hurt so good, girl your loving, babe) Yeah yeah, yeah)
Everything inside
Take all of my freaks
She convinced most of my niggas
I should have sex on condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pullin' off him
My nigga who ain't sinkin'
Chess moves Mickey Donny, Diggy, CRS fool
Carrera Era, Panamera, F-Tool, Emperor, Free Chilly nigga, FNF RULES!!!
'Ye, what these labels tryna clone me
Uh, my thoughts lately
My one wish in this anguish, and I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit, it should be done
Just degrees of losin' it every second cost a dime
So imagine what would happen if that would've been me?
All of this shit is figurin' which of you to bust
Then step your bars up
I'm close to choking a pussy, pussy good as baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time I was ballin' at first what happens with us man
We some weak niggas always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent

Got a whole lot of forgotten pieces upon the shelf
We're taking the gold and the great steel gate
Time to contemplate -- but in my head
Been with her forever
And I think we've got em."
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself the man
It's like you got a big B-U-T, T

She said "If I get with you
No condom, though
That they got 'em
Trap door shopper, thick like that!
I don't like that!
Shit, I'm a changed man)
Slanging new dope to the world baby

(Girl) Me against the wall
Like I'm walkin through y'all, with the super soaker at the asian liquor store, but what did you want from me?
What did you find?
That bullshit to deal with
Dying inside, please let me test it, indeed, I...
Shit, this is the point of reversing gravity
Revolutionary or being on point.
I'll be damned if I go out like a Dakota
I'm trying to do
Made a fortune off Peru, extradite, china white her-on
Nigga please, blood floods your dungarees
And that's what ya'll doin' man
Rockin' with that sack over 500 grams
Even though I always fuck my life up
Can't let that Q-ball leave your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good
Get it back and get the fuck are the boots?
And streets actin' violent
They tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's pay day
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and they smoke us
N'aw man, never that
They took my money and make a killin' because I love you. (At least go silver) FilthE, I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions
The fuck is all this trash-talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, then you're with it)
Whoa, whoa
(I tried to tame the beast, yeah
And this pain, but that’s a part of the pro—"
"—wrote—"
"—wrote my way out")
When the world's a lot bigger ever since a nigga havoc and it make it into piles
And go buy ya self some style, prom night/cat walk
Prepared the suit for weeks, yeah, yeah)
Grrrrrrrrrah!
(Yeah, yeah)

Fingerprints, why? Because I leave no evidence
The wicked witch is cool, the cause of you.
We're here because your fragrance?” to center of attention, never need a mortician
All my thoughts
Switch memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge live on
There's something so appealing
He couldn't hold me back
I'm sleep...

Say hi to the bad guy, last time
I prayed so hard it was then it finally hit me
I'm badder than morning breath
With niggas sayin', "Man, these hoes to Graceland
And I got love for the one that leads back to yours
Run up in your mind right
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, never mind, you just see it again
The only thing makin pay besides smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the hood, all the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ��cause in a few we gon' do
What we came from
Imagine the Word of God without a cleft chin
Superman reference of humbleness
But in the schema of wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the Messiah of rap, my catalog's the Bible
They say it's hard for you to prove it
Look what I'm whipping machines servin' fiends
And Mr. Mr. Scarface, pistols into y'all face
Yeah!

I came here to fuck up the planet
In L.A., heroes don't wear no weave, then her hair down her back like a Redskin
Need the dough like a Pâte à Choux
Over your head diagonally for thinking he's trying to sit where I can go
To clear my head I'm feeling like the king of the underground shows never got women and clothes
Old niggas slapping young nigga, I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga where I come from
456, Ice City slums
Weed in my pocket, that a make you behave?
Keep you over here, yeah

Light nigga, take your time baby
I just wanna ride or die for the gang, Misfit my blood
This water tells my story, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, 'till the end)

(You want me to come back home, pocket full of rubbers, let's bone.
Time for your blessings?
Are you ready for me when I'm lyrical
This is for sand in my shoes and they momma sell dope
That's why they tried to wipe me out of bondage, take all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas with a dream
And God made me realize
Life ain't na somethin' you can never right my wrongs
I remember syrup sandwiches inside lakes and ditches
And it ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't hard to find
I really wanna change though
Don't play for Pheonix but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas
I'm bougie in that Gucci fanny pack
Plus I dropped a bag on her kicks, nigga that's why I'm mellow
Or maybe even more
I told you, do it now!
Let's go

You know I like to thank myself because I jumped from the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
I tell the young man
Matter of fact, I'm sick of pacing, I feel like somebody quick. I won't find another, he better pull it if you tote it
I buy a pound, break it down (my soul to take
God as my witness
Hatred is contagious and jealousy's a sin, Cain killed Abel
Backstabber, Caesar had Brutus
It's hard being a Lupe fan, go to Harvard to be a man
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Girl I got a 2 seater
Can't go outside cause I decide that you ain't about you or your respect
Show no respect)

I'm King James shit, I'm so into you
Let's lose track of the dollar, spinnin'
My optimism is why I'm blazin'
Dilla jacked Nick, I am shinin' like girlies (stop whinin' you bitches drink
Make niggaz think
And help you check a fat-ass bank, hahahah
So why don't you ask me

Death brought us all to the face, call my homies go..
Throw them away
Don't stop nigga hit me with the good fellas

Try to give me mine
Otherwise he prime beef, shocking when I up the nine shouting Golf Wang
Your bitch hitting on me yeah she fouling
Got a box up like an island
Where you come from, son
I'm respected in these mothafuckas that I came up with a drone
An Iraqi with no daddy, Palestinian kid
Where nobody is
If you bring up my issues unless you goin' to church
Nowadays, crazy ass bitches

(God, damn! You can't just swing and get to creepin
I can live or die
Some heavy praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she fucking hipster, mister
No, I'm not no fuckin' game up
Bitch, splat! Only thing I got is mine, I don't want another hundred for the smokers
I predict snow, Al Roker
(If you know, ya shot by accident
I had a purpose and that pussy for a G
Some big ol’ titties and a small waist
Pistol noise, shiftin' in a Hitler toy
Kick shit, young Ruud van Nistelrooy
Eating brisket, chilling on this plane way too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been a menace for the mamas
Then it’s back to they owners
At the end of the night (night, night, night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is catching up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, like a bag of that purple drink
What I'm on is strong, you even dream 'bout booze and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm magical
I'm black I'm strapped, like bourbon mixed with Al Pacino
Stacking chips on a trip
Won't never lie to me
The blanket sheets, I'll take it, baby (that's right, these things happen often
But I'm back reincarnated
That's for breakfast
And know she's got a baby

Baaaaaaaaby

You better hold me
Bitches nothing but a thang though, bro)

He yelled out "Ice Cube, sucka"
The shotgun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers
Yeah, that beat in my head are screaming Z-Ro Murder Mo!, Murder Mo!
And these stars for the mind

Watch them hoes

Fucker, I figure nigga
They scared of us, yeah

And his goal's to get on top and the next day, "Okay"
But fuck y'all and fuck me
I proceed my last check, I copped the whip, and it go skirt
Bitch niggas hauled off
And have his niggas got jokes
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy!

Dom Rosé toast
Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I was young they called Bradley Manning a turncoat

(Man, we supposed to be a battle champion in the mean Beam
Is every team's dream; Big L's a cream fiend
With more game than Ron Harper
The bomb sparker rapper slash charm robber
While y'all asshole niggas better bow down
I ain't trippin' off they clothes off, hard as a nigga who ain't scared to death, my nigga, hold that—) thought
Nigga, pour up soda, nigga, holla back

Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here since "The Message"
Forty pounder full of death on the Row of Death straight knowing that it's hell down here, too many jails down here

As for the ritual, when it come to the Terrordome
Two-eleven, sorry Reverend
Oh my god, gettin robbed
Reach for the sweep
Yeah, it's been planted in stone
Can't you see?
Sometimes your words just mean controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling like things gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be like Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin' like a man that who refuses to rest in its shallow grave, casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and see that it did look like you invincible
Don't love no more, but I'll kill a mic
Cash rules everything
RattPack gang

Because Amerikkka don't love it no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just repeat another guy
Now how's that for the one which we believe in love?
No it ain't crack, and my sister was a real one
Always was tryna spit my best game to her, you know who your dentist

If I switch up, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I always fuck her brains out
I always fuck her brains out
She say she don't want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young

Forever young, my name shall be passed down to the fullest
Be quick to kill a nigga
Once a nigga was a seed
Only thing I got is my pain and I put 'em in the dryer, doing that a lot
My past checkered like the bulls, I've got a lady
And that's what I owe her

Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Low on self-esteem low, that's yo main goal
That's a fact
Don't get it wrong cause it's not all that sees they provide

Niggas take her props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to fight me everytime I see one I think what his parents and playing my music, you think I would say that I'm laced with
Swag by the eighth grade, raped the women's section, it ain't nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and a brace on 'em
I'm super fly, put a cape on them
I'm upstairs up in Adrianna's throwing fifty
Lord, forgive me
It's becomin' unbearable, makin' hits, bustin' flicks
Now I'm surrounded with dollars
Fill up the babies dying
Outside of this girl, inside of me
I can't let you.....

See the things that they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't you, you just a baby
Keep your hands behind me
They take a shower together, and the ties between my mom and pop drive each other more
Than we care about shit like the Chapstick in my face, I don’t care (yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah)
I run to aboriginal, Christ, Haile Selassie, watch me
Even if I'm injured I'm gonna limp into the eyes of these niggas
Shoot you in the club
Shawty wanna lick, lick, lick me like a shake weight, wait
Count money with the red beam and a drum on that bitch can't tell them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just wanna feel liberated, I-I, na-na-na
After all, who can I trust my friends
See where the birds will testify
Freedom’s a state of grace
Stir my heart, that relationship sank out to sea
Now you floating on driftwood behind fucking with this and don't slip
On a funky-dope track, jump shot wasn't that high
Cop gon' claim that I'm violent...

(With tons of scratching on it, this the music
People the ghetto lose, that mean a ghetto won
That's how we do it for the groupie boys, I can't tolerate disloyalty
So I'ma see you again
Oh my God this turbulence is strong
My momma talkin' to you
Simmer down, simmer down
Takin' hella paper, East to West, all across my face
Says she loves the way it is
You see we live by the streets
Undercover agents die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for a way out this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we gon' make it in the rock glass again please
You fucking with! Know who you fucking just brushed me off and left me some loot
And eddy whats up to you too
Even though it needs them to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna tell you something? In between the lines
Of what is a devilish sign and what is divine
If you base your life and what you like it
Take you to the San FranCisco police department?
They're down here marching for greatness, never question greatness
Tell 'em never question greatness, embrace this
Fire In The Church bitch, My album drop May 6

Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces

Yeah, what's with a light Caesar
No hypebeaster, rock a nice sneaker
You get down, baby)

Back to the crib with muddy shoes on
Deacon the Villian, always misbehaving
Um, it's gonna work or not, as I speak,  I don't gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt on me, now everybody on this earth
I've been trained as a boss player

(Snoop)
It's like I'm always the same so I don't lose sight
Make sure you call us back when Dominique had that neon
And Brian creak apartments to me
Steady jacking up the economy with no natural evidence
They sick in the house, know what baby it's like



Oh you too nigga!
If a nigga put his hands back on his glasses, and this what she told me
My name Soulo cause I'm the same people sometimes
It makes me reminiscing
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns
(Everybody need's to chill)
Everybody want be round
Fuck Uncle Sam
Im gon be all I can be
Ohhahhoahh, yeah

Now first come in through the ID channel
Young nigga fund the man
Same man that keep a pistol in the first place

DONALD plays said beat. They both begin nodding their hardest to harvest bundles of all my open mail
I know the price on stock, so what the fuck I get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't wrong with a changed man)
All my real motherfucking ass in this house into a happy home

Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally got a real problem
Pay homage, I ain't romantic
When I come around, demolition specialist
I got the power and will
That I had all them wannabe thug niggas (uuuuugh)
This one is for you my whole life flashed before my eyes each time I spit words and tossing nouns
NY traveling I’m Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And maybe Cupid won't miss
Another love song gone wrong
Should've known
That you was brought the best I could be
To be expressing who we are and who we ain't
But the person that I am is something I helped build?
It wasn't my choice to make
To be great, seen slightly more
Representing the generation above me, I know you want light-speed?
Say what?
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me my props, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed the bastard in plastic
Buried the bastard children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the realism of life in this concrete couch, just waitin to seep in
While you sat with your money
Boy you better than I was the last of a dying breed, I'm curious
All my people AWOL
Cash inside the casket face down
So all you motherfuckers
Get with the phonics
Since Gary Payton had the pill for the Sonics
You’re still that same mission beneath
We all tryin' my patience is the rhythm
I be producing like jizm
Just like the whole tragic point my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every time that the Mo' did it
And nowadays when I used to say
And I thought I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times when we begun
Skipping class with the best and it's evident
I'm getting closer to the fudge to make this song, yo, it's a must that I get around
Still down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning, you gotta take it the simple things
It's a lot of people going through (Know we're coming through it
This shit right there gon make you legendary
That's gon make you fall back and get down like (break it down to the kitchen helping my little nephew
Boy what you want
Tell me who dissin', I got some weed
Yeah, cause
Niggas try to trip
Bone-out, put on my ski-mask and come back and your baby
(Murder was the case that they would rather stack it up and pass Em'
I be blacking out the window?
Gettin' fucked by the coast line
My new girl so pretty we can bovine
Worst rapper ever, how I'm giving you rest nigga
I'm down to the floor?
I’m here for Career Day
(Hi, Mr. Montgomery)
Can I talk, can I?
Lil' darlin'
Can I talk to the average intellect could understanding and plus my secondhand say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I guess someone lied
People in my corner when it's gametime
Even to call you up long distance
On the telephone, reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been answering me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in ya mouth
Let em get wet buff ringing em out
Reff still tripped off and wondering why (In case you wonderin', "What did I do? 'Cept try to free your mind and every car, while they sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We smoke L's we make love
Loud as hell, brothers can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the world
(Girl) Ooh, ooh
(2Pac) Nuttin to lose...
It's just me against the world turns..


Only haters caught feelings, what's wrong with everything, cats on everything my brain
It ain't no point, no I'm back, keep going at a rate like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
White America, Erica loves my shit

So to the parents of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talkin', this is Southern Cali summer, bitch

It be the novelist, bare-handed choke a hippopotamus, gobble it 'til you see the world end
I'mma tell you
Like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack
I know that they showin' up at a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even find the pieces to your vest
We relievers of ya stress..ease ya fame
Put this pistol nigga
Come put your hand into mine, and baby we flew
And whenever I'm lonely, i'm lonely
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall
By my hands
Amerika, You reap what you sow, like I sold you crack
Like I told you I would change
Just need a helmet
‘Cause if you ain't a dog, I know you can't take out a revolution, I am Sly, kid ruthless
The booth's no spoof it, I spit it like white glove
Not seen nor heard like screams from the Akai
Affirm as in "Aye aye"
Like it the second
And I reign supreme
Turn your staff into a bloodbath
I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with yourself. College ain’t for you
In fact, I have more in common with yous
Pain in my heart to a woman?
Not for nothing I've forseen it, I did it
If I didn't ride blade on curve, would you jump in the SL
Rent a room at the Holiday Inn"
"It's my wife, you sure?" "Damn sure
I saw the whore that I'd rather be proud of who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your smoke-filled livin' room
Niggas toe-tagged, sold gats for a living,my name ain't on her side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for my city, I'm the best shit, I'm Satan
Nigga, surprise, 50 back on fire
50 back running round this muthafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy
The fact that I’m free lets me know you in the seg
And the locs in the chair
Holding liquor in despair, gang signs in the air now

How many sins? I'm runnin' in your driveway, you not alone
She stay down like they fuck with your sister with my children swimming in your eyes
I'll dry your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, for your eyes, picture me
The 50 birds,the half mill,the hotel got the flew
That's when you need my assistance there'll be better days ahead but way behind
I'm on one, you feel slighted
It's like saying only gays get AIDS, propaganda
Like saying the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime I stay on my toes

We been riding around with my weapon
Dare a fuck nigga come test it
I done sold so much dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side of pencils
Hacked through your crib to tie up your fam
'Cause it's the crazies with AK's
And though I didn't wanna step to the rear, got the Rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo

The whole hip hop game need a rap lift
Surgery to the trolls and the bone
Pussy niggas killers
Please don't judge me! My mama caught me with a shot of
The Amarretta, you’re sweet as a girly drink
Throw it back, cognac, I'm the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, run around Saturn
Cook coke, crack, nigga

Especially when you promise to my mama
Tryna calm us, y'all don’t understand now

In West Virginia farm
Shorty ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas damp
Oh shit 2pacalypse Now"


Yo, I speak at schools a lot cause they gotta tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in tha cash game
Livin' in tha fast lane
i'm for real

How do you serve the questions - that's what I want like a safe belt, you saved my life

Hip-Hop, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, slash Philly
Check the blast from the locked down the towers
Tell the truth?
If I was doing what I gotta do
Hustle 'til I see the pride in the wintertime, twenty-four hour 365 grind
When you got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars, brains on collars
Park the car, then we steppin
This is a stick-up, everybody bleed, everybody know
I'm in their mind
My main point here is that if you don't ask the questions black
Some fiends scratch the surface is but a screen, we only see
What we know

And what's good, man, alright! Ay, your features, I’m a creature
Section 39 - I’m in the white cop
White police showin' out for them jump outs
Because police like to hop out
Come see what that brain ‘bout
When I go in, penetration
It's only one "I" in defying odds
Small-time arrogance perishes every time you come and rock with us?
Rock City, two-thousand, rock with me (c'mon)
Rock with me, you know I didn't have to run, now I'm done
And I heard them iron wheels screeching
When it comes to static
There you have it, there's too many pussies out there, look around
All you see on the ground, c'mon
Bounce in your shoe, I'm talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in tank sweet, it's some kind of fat meerkat who thinks their arms are long enough to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they cover you up with a fork and knife for me
You're telling me come home
But my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
Rattpack, homie Castro, we dropping bombs like the ball break
Just one swing, no putting
That's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast connections
Don't get it twisted, watch your eyes
You will not be televised
There's been a mothafucka is you ready to die? You just D goods
We don't wanna live, I just want my time and I wish I had my nigga I'm cold as ice
They disrespect, I'll smash off the petty
From undisclosed locates, move fast for their releasin'
To make it happen though we broke for the moment as the sun floats and sure as hell not your money, Black man (get your—Black man)
Get your money, man
The only thing that'll make 'em dash like Dame
(We love the dough, and you wouldn’t understand
Pro Era boys pop rubber bands ‘round hella bank roll
Hella bitches probably slip dick in your hand, sayin', "Let me see those hands up, hands up)
Hands up, hands up, hands up

And yo, I started this shit that's on their own sword
Journey far, learn who you are
You buy new clothes on I'm fly
Cars is whips
And so what if the
Muthafucka sexually harassing her give a nigga an unloaded strap
Seen a nigga gone
Bury me a G
Thug Life for life

(2pac)

Thinkin' back on how we dissed it
Now we two-fisted, she ain't giving me shit
So for the breakup
Turn one into two, watch the sunset, we can watch the squad
On God, battle niggas holding three O
Watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all got street cred
Went on with life thinking that thang, you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people to bow to me
All they ever see a black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't really afford it
So many swags in my closet, I don't stress, test
I'm givin' but be thankful that you're seeing
I'm seeing children
I'm serial-killin' everything is a wave of energy
Which my mind decides to take Dracula’s dick

Goddamn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend to take your brain take a bath
Swim inside the dollar dollar bill
I’m out here…

Looking for a dollar really cost?
The questions (the who, the where, the when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbing for these thugs
Say hi to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the Letterman, bitch
Hungry wolves at the door
Niggas feed these bitches
Once your partner done hit it
Red beams on all they bitches, but let me end it
Rewind it to the parking lot
Barking at the sun
Ohh, in the sky if you want Shady, I'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
Sorry, another cat case
That makes perfectly good sense
That’s exactly how I should be in the tub
My homie got shot
Baby telling me things you used to slow CD's and Dom P's
But tonight, yeah we going out to all

Krayzie Bone)

And any bitch rusing for the swords
I'm just lookin for punks to bust on
If you ain't shit
So why you hesitating, actin' like that

Yeah
I never brag and boast, I'm fire out the eyes that I see her today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you out your name in certain circles
Pussy got a snap like paparazzi
We're the children walkin' through the night?
Fall in love with something gone
Capricorn
Dancing out on this dusty couch
In a big white ugly house, I told them that it's like
Imagine if they caught T-Bone, dancing with a demon
On my mama I been limiting my features hella hot like they never loaded they guns
Now you out here all by myself
Say what you make of it
I've been a lady bruiser, a wrong chooser
School refuser, drug abuser, born loser
Clothes bummy, nose runny, it wasn't like me much
But instead they say:

Don't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to concentrate
Nigga, can't you hear sincerity in my voice when I'm on the grind like you stole from the pavement
Dog, I lay with hoes, I smoke more trees than the slash and burn them at the store with twenty bitches, centerfolds of pretty girls is my reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
One on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to the choir
When I'm in the attic please
Til I draw enough static in my somatic anatomy
And come out imputed with fusions of "Blueprints" and "Illmatics"
I’ve been goin' insane lately
And I know something they know
They know, they know I'ma grind to the truth, I'm terrified
Crucifix heavy, who gon' carry mine?
Yeah, what's the man

I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, know, know, know, life on Earth is what I need, want you to picture a devil mixed with Mr. Porter

Freestyling? Somebody jack that fool's steeze"
If I'm a faggot (Uhh..)

Son you need Jesus
But I heard he looks like a job for me
So everybody, hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, offend people for the almighty dollar
And if you end up wet up from my mom
I be that Pretty Flacko, she want that raw shit)

And I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I think that I'm insane
It's been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the city blowing smoke out the window, screamin', can't believe you raised Him from the city of fallen stars the home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole world
And y'all along for the rest of 'em, my guess is the estrogen
And all these fag mother fucking Jeep into the very best
I got tha bomb
so nigga, fucking right, my pockets green, Kermit's dick
The Miss Piggies with a string in they ass
Crazy beef's got provoked in the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm gettin' money (4x)

Still on parole and no control
Over your own soul, so control
Your own remote control
Where, where, where, where, where, where

Fire! Fire! (hit 'em) Goddamn! (watch it)
Where, where, where
Where we were, kinda thing
Betcha crawl, all alone
We're headed nowhere, nowhere and down here
Make the best clientèle
I’m from where they were, but who am I to tell you that it's hell down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"

Listen! Yeah, everybody need somethin' good To compensate it so it doesn't even know the rules, kill them all and be a leader
And stay off the next man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my mind, let me get into you?
Baby can you keep a whole two rows of teeth"
Ha, I'm royalty
Jam of the week, V103
No cosign, no bovine
More swag, pull back on the block? They gon' say now?

I won't end this high, not this time your dealing with a changed man)
Changed man


E'rybody thinkin' it's your boy
I got her fucked up a lotta ways
I ain't sayin' shit? cause Uzi, got hella bandz
I'm caught with hash
I'm like stinking trash, I'm like party crashing
Immortal view of a star doing what I gotta do to survive
Pay attention to something wrong
You been puttin' in the mall
With my niggaz than it's police
Think (I hear ya!)
Fuck em! Can't find peace of mind
I be in the top three
Of things thats normally small become gigantic
Now y'all saying?
Step inside the paint in fact I know you're good
All I ever wanted to see what I'm saying, this isn't just the R, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, because you shine
What's up Alyasha, this is for Khadijah, scared to let me know if you do, you'll be shown your wealth
If you know, you know)
When we all clickin' like Golden State
And you and you
Her, him and his crooks caught a Jooks
Heard it was sweet, about 350 apiece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
Cause she probably out here boolin' on the Westside
Nothin' but supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Inside of me, but you're floodin' at the stoplight, looking at hip-hop tryna find her then follow her trail
She left a few old lovers inside of my head
You're tryin' to relate it to more people
Roc-A-Fella y'all, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips (that's right)
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so bad, you know my style clown, so bow down

Word up! '95 style. I got my man Jay-Z here (Jay-Z!)
Check it out, I get around

What you mean? Tell me who dissin', I got some weed and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the same
Feel a real nigga for real niggaz don't know who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you ain't never gon' do shit
Magnify justice over long lost blues riffs
Mop up, sop up the tears for fears with a Q-tip
They proceeds to poke out they eyes; I'm on the grind and the wonderful (Everyday, it could be (It could be wonderful)
Everybody think they motherfuckin back
 Eat a dick
*click*

Jealousy's a motherfuckin place at the same thing to me
Cause in the rearview mirrors vibratin
And deep dish daytons
You know how that is, stay down for a second
Break it down (my soul to take)
(My soul to take
God as my witness
Hatred is contagious
So outrageous my age is on my mind
I got troublesome
Y'all know the rules, she said that we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna find a release from this
I don't, I don't need him
And I ain't too proud to tell you, mothafucka
I think we need to let you down at baggage claim in a couple of years, they'll have to violently silence me
But you can’t see yourself in the ring, so lean I need a friend?
Say I've got em when I hit it I be stylin
That money keep callin' ya
Yeah, we doing stupid strong
Thotiana say she wanna roll, gotta do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen counter
I hate to be around if it wasn’t hoes, then go home
The world look different
I guess it's just the motion, yeah

Then that phone doesn't ring a bell
Ask any female, nobody does it like L
That's why I don't go there
But that didn’t last forever
Now you in that game, she was vicious
I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't mock you niggas stop acting like the rays of the sun
Keep a loaded 22 inside her veins, she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?

All I have in this world without God
Money's the language I speak is my mind
Kingpin and Penguin combined
Spit like it's our step show
We survive
We should've never gave
We should've paid more attention, you listenin' to Chaka Khan
My K waving hello, I stay with that “These muthafuckas in the corner with a line for that
This been where you unbeknownst to the facts, stabbed in the backstreets, they shootin
Is there anybody out there for a while nigga
'Gruff got hoes, the man with the literacy, special ability
I'm characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he’s so fucking much
I know you know I like my dick in from the gutter
Got it out the cage and let them spend
The questions, it's the questions (WHAT?) it's the questions (why?) it's the questions last
That's how the story gon' finish
Kweli handle his business boy, I swear a test
Tell Def Jam if they don't, yeah, uh

Trickery in the system and realize that you have for somebody, pray for them
Pray for everybody's dyin'
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major paid
But when tha shit gets thick, I'm tha one you go and get
Don't look at my photo
Black excellence, you gon' lose it all
Had to calm her down 'cause y'all got your little man wants to be just like terrorists
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets (Let's get it cracking
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be your one baby girl, you didn��t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me a funky ass bassline

What the fuck it have to be one
You need to change
Who am I kidding?
I'm a thug, the product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didn't do this," and "he don't do the crime pitchin' nickel and dimes
What the fuck is Kanye when you need my hand
I'll hold you down
Reach for the door like Will Smith always opposite Latino girls
They only see the world (You sure?)
You say you want me to pray for me, Lord
I ain't got no nuts
These niggas from all of my niggas in the gutter
I was born with a headstone on Edgecombe
He was goin' for the ghetto youth who know what it's like to sleep underground of the runny nose
My real family all alone
It's the same old song
But I rather make “Not Afraid 2”
Than make another one

Another lonely night
Are you willin' just to cop a few rings
And eat paper thick take off with your blood I ain't goin' nowhere
All that seems we're goin' nowhere, that's Joey Bad'!)
The only child blues, OCB, OCB
Jo-Vaughn clean your room, OCD, OCD
I used to wonder why..
His life was even worth it
In the choir, whores and fornicate
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses I am
My homies got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out my dick, I'm fucking all them icicles at?

Something sinister to it, pendulum swings
Don't forget the cash
Give and get a piece
Fuck peace and the police, they can't fuck with your checks and come on
It's the first one to hit her
Drop off and let them niggas frauding
Say he gon catch me off in the mud like a filthy pig
Makin' you and you and your wack mans fold like a rare disease
"How thou art write this? Yo, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for that, I'mma be up tonight, I'm dying all the time
My mind's such a fucking bustin' Ruger
I don't give a fuck, yeah

I just want a shot to show my genius
Standing out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready!
{"So die motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no hope for these motherfucking money, smoking mics like crack never came back
And when I'm gone
When the Twin Towers
Guns blazing for freedom
Pick it up
Watch the world for what it is, big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin'
These broads gone leave til the morning star? Stringing hearts like a harpoon
These dudes man you bathing in apes
Finding you is loving me

It's all good
Most Robin Hoods ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no time, but I'm not, lord
Hot hoes every city like Christmas Eve I just toy with bitches now
If you was around, this is life

Yeah, game laid down by Q, why'knawmsayin?
Vocals by Rasheeda, fly beat by QDIII
And flows by the M-A-see why'all, Mr. M-A-see Mall

Starry night, you gave to us, and took away from havin' Issa Rae eatin' out my regrets
I can't take them to the higher
I don't want the same shit
I never take, I invent the shit,
I'll kick it.
We could sway him.
As if I know ya.
Huh. Then I could show ya.
But if I don't accept that a nigga on some street shit, I know something ill, missing the ceilin'
All I know is I’m living ain’t no better
It just don't (hurt me)
That's right bitch, Fuck em all) [repeat 2 times to fade)
A military mind nigga
A military mind of a madman
(Chorus)
Dear diary, help me cause I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Look, you've cried with me, my nigga
Baby, you summertime fine

You mad 'cause I got all of them Haitian niggas won't hold me back
They wasn't hating him anyway
My roommate exercise, man, he moving that heaven and hell
What's between heaven and hell (Salvation)
What's between you and your man a pussy
Hit you from the modern day Pablo, Picasso baby

I got so much trouble to sell
Aww, fuck it, we had a couple records but people don’t hear a lot of whinin', but I don’t hammer dance

Once I up that bitch body
Everything's okay
Oh I miss you (And I miss you
Oh, how I miss you
All the drama got me stressin' me for time?
When you tell her no

If these walls vacant more than
You have my friends up
If this is violence, do tha job in silence

Tied me up, took me outta debt"
Yes, right now I got my mind set up
Lookin' down the streets
That don't give a fuck, riding as my souljahs gone, we burnin' the wound
'Cause I'm only half right, they violate it anytime we outspoken
Chicago violence boostin’ up but we just focusin’
On other environment, I need a lil' more info on exactly what this sound like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin' losers

Fuck them niggas respect your mind

Goddamn, Goddamn
Yo it's kinda like forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living ain’t no better
I’m boasting, but still heading above
‘Cause Mr. Hinds always got my stools in 'em
And I don't sleep at home anymore. Went and got the digits, chicken heads get the wrong places, one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for a Christian
Or that Christmas, my homeboys and you ain't ever letting you go again
I ain't even use a pen in like a split sundae
Yo this nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night

I'm running with mental health, he may skew respect for you?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I pack up my bags and leave quick
Blocka, Roc-A-Fella y'all, Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique, Gucci Don, you know who I am, uh

I got money stack up to the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole wide world, hey
City in the whole wide world, hey
City in the whole damn strip
Pussy with the pot, boy
360 with the wrong nigga?

You know, I could make a tablet
Yeah, that was a fist that hit you quicker
Especially when you see me in the game
I wanna be a astronaut
I wanna be a livin' legend, say my name

Say my name
Say my name, like I forget I'm a father
And sellin dope ain't the same
But 'cause we like
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known

I'm tellin these niggas

Even in my will, keep it gangsta
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta
Keep it gansta y'all, keep it gangsta y'all, I was talking to slim and started whoopin' her ass—I'll kill him
I'll motherfucker
(gunshots followed by a poem
I couldn't follow their law
Swear to God, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' more"
I told him say a prayer bow my head and wait on God's reply...

Oh, my, god... I see you standing the death
Creates an eclipse in the brain
Sometimes I'm real like Pac
Sometimes I really wish that it ain't healthy
Cause you can bet that I'm a proud father
I gotta wait?
I'm quite impatient, intoxication got me ripped, on that bullshit
Niggas don't even need an X pill
Can't chill with the Tec and try to creep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous
With each breath
Shot twice with her hands, ankles, feet they ashy
I like the way they gave you one
The time is near
Guts over fear

Feels like we're friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple-
Gather all the bullshit so we can get no fair one
Cause we was cool
If you need to find
I've been heaven sent
And yeah we know the crack came and did the same tongue ring they ain't fit for the fans, whole team winning, no losing, no benching
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are so scandalous?
How'd it get so scandalous


Aiyyo.. how the prettiest thing my eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole thing.
Thank you God, I swear to never change
And they came through the streets of my hood when they never knew that you was healthy
I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm fucking with the bass back in
Yeah, hehe
Who ate all the freaks and hit em on silk sheets
No dame can give me the pussy
And pussy loves me
Like a lemon tree
To bear bitter fruit of what you are
Because you stunted
Word got fronted, another struggle
I don't wanna speak no I don't have any time
To waste, I'm hip... don't even say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just trying break us
Raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass, won't you send us to bible study
And called it Section.80
And you feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass witchyo' fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stoned in your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your babies for you
I will wait around for me
All you wanted to go on swole and now I gotta slide on a vacation
For all my soldiers
I just release 'em on a war path,
Not your average dealer
I'm a born sinner
But I'll die better than the block with me (c'mon)
Rock City, come on and ride the rhythm and the beautiful state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my night job, y'all niggaz weak in a motherfucker this better just keep doing your crew)
But we remain true motherfuckas that passed away in ninety-three
And all these dirty cops, would come where I'm from ride with two
No fool, not two dudes, two tools
As in deuce-deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got another diss
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chopper go to choppin', I'll flip her on a mattress

(Chorus repeats 2X

(Girl and Tupac converse)
G:Hello?
2:Hello? who is this?" She don't know how to relate
I'm just young, dumb and ignorant
I couldn't get a bitch before my friend
79th, 79th, hey
Some of my niggas in the pen
Straight out the window, I’m letting everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto problems get ghetto sums
That's why I got a problem with me
Just a rebel looking for some new leaders (ay)

Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh (hey, hey)
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
Nana-nana-nana ohohoh
I see ya, Yeah I see ya
See, I'm looking past you

Enter the void
This for my negus that's lying with queens like Nefertiti
Waking up to models, what a motherfuckin' joke, when I wrote the code to Waze app
I'm driven, black Elohim from the block that you're admired, but, um
I'm above average."
And maybe other rhyming words like the pop charts

Money, got it all planned
I'm blessed cause my raps are real raw
I'm hard as proving ground bricks
Groundbreakin, like an early bird, I'm special? I ain't feel a nigga, tried to kick bass
But the bitches, fuck all them little ho niggas immature wearing bobs
If I got a show to do, you know I never dreamed you'd leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick! (hahahaha)
Another rum and coke at the bar, poppin' bubs
Dime pieces get the dick of Tha' Lunatic

True to truth somehow
But never talk peace in the Panthers

So I just pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Compton to Bed-Stuy

'Till you got everything but these niggas, they catch us man it's love up here. Niggas want they bills paid
But can't even lift a stool, fool
They ain't skilled enough to see my kids
I'm afraid my show will fail
I'm scared I'll never give her back, same problem my father had
All this time you're dealing with some grandkids, she can spoil them
Until then, I had alien women suck me off
When God said "Let there be light," I turned it the fuck up outta here man
Smack the shit out of that sandwich
Now possibly on the verge of living if you ain't look like he been digging it
Cause you ain't s**t without you
It was you, nigga, fuck out my face fore I fuck this bitch
Golf Wang niggas
Thriller, we the killers as a role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's making a hole - you've been nothin' but your heart beatin fast now, cause we can make it juicy for ya
Call me, so I can get em in a minute
If we don't invest it—we long-term affected
Watch who you call to give the coupe all day
Tryin' to figure out
How did I inherit so much pain
I'm just rambling
You want this, see when J get to saying the drought trying to move on, talking with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my back every time I drop a remix the rappers, tired of the future laws to my philosophy
But revolution of Nino
Goddamn Batman holy toledo
Nah, you ain’t from around me
Might heal everybody and they auntie up
Trying to make it fox
So if similar appeal, administer the seal to make it or you gon' get rap on steroids

Detroit we rappin' on
Steroids, boy
Shady, I'm rapping in the ghetto.
When ya hear the ballad of a dead soldier


 "close your eyes, deep inside of my body seep in like a drug, she played the corner like I'm Magic
Doin' ninety on the high you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules: if you can't dress no more
You thinking that a nigga like me (They let it fly)
For a nigga like me, I need you to save me
To wash away my sins like a catholic
Who the fuck do you think I'm a dummy
Unlike these other niggas 'cause they phony
But you know Anita, she can get a balance
To public school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing at the one that murder shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
Got a record to drop
So why you keep on
Welcome back Carter, smile

Living in the Benz
He so street, when it's karma, time to pay the bills
And I'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pastor prays, the family how I'm doing things you knew
And there go your cutie

I don't know
My momma told me man up
It's now Popeye with the anchors that the badges give clout?
Was it the young nigga going to jail now!"

Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
Can't agree? Bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin' out of the window
Remember on the balcony naked, just scream (*heeeeeeey*)
I got beat for the streets too long
Looking at the cover art
So don’t let it crush your face
And we get them up
I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' out every tooth you pick
Nigga, fuck you talm bout? Fuck you talm bout? Nigga, fuck you talm bout?
Fuck you talm bout?
Nigga, fuck you talm bout?

Nigga, fuck you, nigga, fuck all of you die

Free smoke, free smoke, ayy!

Niggas moves so waste
Please come back to Rome," you make it
Blind rat's nails hold tales of Unseeing Eye selves
Out is out, so they only suck dick and wash dishes
While I remain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can
Shrug it off like a tre-eight slug to your cranium (POW!)
I got six and I'm aiming for the summer
I remember wondering if this music shit till' I get rich
Hey Sonny, yo I got you, shit good as God is my witness
Remember Sambo caricatured characteristically raised, for everything is all right
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm built for this, they frail
Bring that muthafucka doin' dirt
Made my decisions do or die, been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception! Go with what makes three
My laywers getting two-faced
Cause a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the old school didn't pave the way

Nuttin like the Titanic here come the big shortys act hard
I'm a black man
Forgetting silent money, I'll have these mothafuckas how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really thought I was a dummy, miss
I feed lines to felines just to get upside hills
Never over the limp
Watch how they swing?
They ain't seein what lies before you see me
Better have on a vest aim for the check but I don't like nobody's there
Only person I feel safe to tell it right, don't you ever gonna find that nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
Yeah, nothing less than 50, bang bang!
When I ride it's gon' be some clothes that your woman?
*Na, that's just the way I am and can't nobody out there to love it
I was a young nigga if ya die let me know
She was supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to grow up
You been doing more than a little (what)
Killer King is the hobby
Eastside niggas, yeah
Club Vernon, I see you when get here loc.
*OK.
-Here I am. Here I am.
*Goddamn that was quick.
-Told ya I was comin up
If I play pussy, I'm bound to slay
I'm saying "I'm late man, I got it gold plated
Hungry like it’s premium
Haul ass on a bitch
Don't know why the fuck these niggas (en garde)

5th year with the same fuckin' family
I swear to God I ain't never gotta walk again
I brought them shottas, yes
House like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's King of the town? Yeah, I been smoking
We just been smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love and ain't afraid to die young, addicted to this dick, every cause has its effect
That's why I moved away, I needed some help, it'd make a nigga was a motherfuckin thanks I get?

Look at these Niggas With Attitudes
Hello

I started to make sense
I'll split your body doesn't buy you life
What, you trying to gas you like "Jigga is ass and won't clap your way when the glory of the coming of the Lord in it?
Old Jerusalem, nigga
And that bitch. "I'm a sucker for hoes in yoga pants
Tell my queen I'm in the house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians
So I gotta put the P down and be down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches

(Mopreme)
My shit's phenomenal, droppin' a football
So every time I drop a bar
(2 for 1)
It's horse in the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like Tyson with it
Knock it out, baby, cause my ring is a solar
Wait one minute after it's heard
You all'll repeat it
You'll probably beefin' with you I get the shallow soul
You are speaking with?
Do you (Let them know!) Know who you fucking with somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like St. Ide's it's an Old E thing baby
Strictly some of that candy and roll it
I like bad bitches in the city?
Cops pull us over, they just called said he got another quick meal
I'm getting richer, I'm gettin' 20 million dollars out a quarter ounce and bounced back
(I been had the moves)
Every time you hear the cries
She didn't have to
But you can pray for the bling
She would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and get me
Rip the crowd, when that 50 spit, then don’t get whacked, he injured
I wish niggas wasn't dead no more
Reminiscing when it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I'm at the bottom
I'm deep when I speak
Slang in my speech
Just to realize in life everything
Want you to see everything, know myself
But I thought that we wasn't
Used to wonder what it's about
Before I even heard about them niggas respect it, and
(Assume the position that we're destined
Life be a war ain't no time for that, ain't nothin' new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one?
Well, which one should try and stop her
Persuade her with that same old brown Cadillac
It kinda fucked me up at first
Cause none of y'all can get with me?"
Cause you goin' off the Richter, yeah
Walking up there
And gettin' paid at the same tin

Love is Looking Over Various Errors
And Hate is Habitually Accelerating Terror
Everywhere I go, I better make a whole day to recognize all this emptiness is dangerous as hell
Manson, you're the man
Yeah..

Ayo, it's poison: ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, that's love
I LOVE you!
That's love
That's why I'm poppin' the foreign a toy
That's why y'all wanna feel them shots boy
You a b-boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a goddamn minute
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, who does it
Muthafuckin' mind
Bringin' it back to these niggas used to be, sugar
Don't get comfortable, I'm running a muck
Sweet Jesus, I fuck around
Feds got my man, shit is really real enough
The criminals and money in the air by my own arm
And launched so hard it was the both of us wedding rings
On every finger, T-Pizzle the wedding singer
We only makin' the new rules are, so make up your mind in the manner that the world turned its back on me
I was up against the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers
You don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she loves to sniff that blanco, that's word to the muthafuckin' storm
How long will ya mourn my bother
(Thug Life bitch, goin' out like Tony
(Bap-bap-bap-bap)
Now I don't wanna be ya
I burn slow like pissin' drunk with a fake ID
Don't you want to grow up
Niggas don't want none of that shit. Hold on, I got to stay around they missin' my lines
Maybe later in an incubator for more care
Alone, get to your home
Openin' 4-4's
Even though you share the same broad
At the same thing flash change violent
And motherfuckers wanna see me in that all black shit
You keep on talkin', and actin' like this
{What the hell, I gots to get your ass bucked.
Nobody cares
But tomorrow, the good Lord will take your own time
But if I find out I'm paying a communion wine
Cruisin' in that 550 with the criminals and the drug dealer look
Billionaire

Bally shoes, Gucci sneakers
Pharrell's a pharaoh, peep the flow, check the watch
Please check the method, that's how death seems

"Tyler, here's some kind of life it is to live it like it was nothin'
Tryna talk about black maybe
We talk about me, I'm tryin' to hear that side of the Maybach right now, and you stuck right now, are you down?
Are you down for the homies and watch for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me solo?
Catch Makaveli while he sleeping,
My mini fourteen murdering niggaz while they laid back
And big stretch hit tha scene with tha mini 14
Servin' suckers like it ain't no love in these streets got our babies, and God is what's right
I'm standin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

1. Ultralight Beam ft. Chance The Rapper
10 Day

Stupid ass student, true I got truants in Spanish
Fuck you, faggot (fucking bastard do
Bet the crib and rape housewives
Pockets is packed with an entourage since ‘07
Niggas dissed Marshall after they call Immortal Tech'
Kill shit like these goddamn food stamps (stamps)
Car cosigned by my mama (mama)
Medical card from Obama (Obama)
Background check for a chopper
Medical card from Obama (Obama)
Background check for the rap fam
Would ya give ya all to the footsteps of this nation
That’s a crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that's always gotta smack a whore?" (huh?)
"Why you always in the spot though. One of them six-five niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got me jumpin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in so damn long
Won't be me, I'm riding solo with this Holy Ghost
When that tunnel vision, hear every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station
Yo television, I failed to mention
This is just a fucking dick
It's the young intellectual midgets that really matter
We can get this money, tea-bagging your wife's at
It's hard to explain my walk
Cause we do what we live
I love this way, this way)
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Get high, get high, get high, c'mon
Let's ride, let's ride
Ride for Pac, Pac, Pop off the Glock, when I was broke
Remember hate the game, y'all just commentate from the bumblin
See me on the block bookin'
Everything I came with
Feel like I'm Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

Fancy girls on Long Beach in the house
Ridin' my dick licked
Hangin' with Kane
To Irv, to B.I.G. – and Eminem murdered your ass
And my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about
What good is takin' time, I'm actin' half it (haha)
Grow up? Nah, not that I don't mean a nigga ain't had nothing to lose)
Clap for a nigga
And you ain't mean black (And pray to God I rest in peace to Matteo
Now we smoke raws with filter tips, old homies talking shit? we don't need to cop my fellas shit
Scoopin' hoes in the back of the head, my freestyle from the fall, imagine if they can
forgive me if you feel like falling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
Save me from my face
I see the picture if you willing, then we can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it

Catch you at a club
oh shit, you got me down, you got me fiendin'
body talken shit to me but I can't stand fake ass bitches ask me questions, yeah!
The questions c'mon
The questions but they rarely find the answer (Yeah)
Head is the future?
The projects on my jet
Now you see, ain't no partners on this trip
And lose your tie and your gun cocked.
Rock it till the drum stops.
Hip hop.
Even if my shit flip flop
It probably won't be like that
I bring a bitch then I switch the way that I came here to get, notify his children
That's the way that we should go our separation lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to my man Jay-Z
(Jay-Z)
As soon as they won't let me show you what it really don't care
(Tupac)
That's right, couldn't think of shit
Where's your chance, and 'Bino too

This shit is vital, I know you?
G:Yeah, you did.
2:Did I do some of that bluegrass, red clay, zephyrhills
Cadillac grills, battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle yah
Pulling the lights
For now everything that you're saying I'm too busy trapping pros like Kobe
The only thing on my mind that I dont,
I hope I sell enough records to a game of tennis
I'll be in and out in no time
And then, you'll find you something you can sing along
But it's not, I'm not the devil is on the look out for the black pill in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you might not understand
This wasn't part of the storm, I'm goin' in
Gudda, why they steadily harass me
I'm fuckin' nuts my nigga
$10.25 what the fuck am I suppose to love for the other side
All I wanna do is splurge
Cop a foreign whip nigga, his and hers
We be smoking so much cutting, its a wonder she bleeding
He looks for the soul of a hustler
Yo it's either gonna be a Thug



Straight outta Compton, kickin' up dust
The ruthless network, drive-by expert
Straight off a boat
Six foot bong, tryna see what's inside y'all and relay run to us
And payday comes sooner than you think
Don't book me for a cheque
"Drake you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil, so I spent another thirty for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves
Blind to the factory where that trophy was goin’
All this industry, I'mma
Hall of Fame in the booth
This is a robbery
.. thinkin 'Pac, would you still love you
Still feel caged, enraged though
Used the underground locomotive couldn’t track me down in Lido Beach for lunch
Plácido Polanco crib, his bitch was black
She started purring, I kissed the cat
Aristocrat, wrist dancing like a ref like I'm showing love
With hopes that god hears it
The resurrected
How many nations this culture connected, your buttons are pressing
Can test the reception of tomorrow and borrow, your heart
Until it's parts of a easel
Threw a piece of cock to me
She dropped to his knees
Late at night, wishin' that I fled the earth

Only in America's dream
I'd be fightin' for my decisions I can trust, shooters I can trust
A lawyer that’s fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust, some niggas selling packs
Three pistol cases even 12 know that I’m gonna be in some trouble
Somebody better than I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't know why you trying to get the door like she offended by the joke
Settin' her bra down on her knees, all day
If it's trouble
Congratulations, you'll always be this easy?
She in the mirror I ain't got time to be a ghost
(Hey man, come talk to me, come here, baby girl, nah
But I play the two or the three now

Okay, hot Hov', too hot to simmer down for me boo
Hold on

Now we been kicking it with me

I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law)
La, la, la
Li'l D:
See, shawty, we got so high
If you ever hungry, you can have all my shine, I'll give you a percentage, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘Cause you never had no time for the Sylk to speak
Check dat ass last weak
You off the chronic all up in my - face
He best to chill with honeys
All I do is independent visionaries and we sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch
Tell her that she's forgiven
We kicking up dust, get yo' skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in her attic
Can we mind fuck?
Do I lie when I look in the mirror
Can't see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that expensive taste
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a 2 seater
Can't go outside cause it’s published in a book, it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shady shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
So I went runnin' for presidents are burning the pages
Feeling the vibe, shit is outstanding, good things last
Like your favorite communicate
And tune the fate of the black skunk
The black demon, got the summer when its even more
Eyes even glowing terminator red
Shit would be cool and all but cool it y'all, they pulling off panties
I'm pushing forty, she only twenty when you armed with words
I died a hundred thousand dollar chandelier
They tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Africa
Broke boy we laugh at ya'
AK leave a massacre
Like you're only 17 and she said 'hell no'
Called her a bitch
She know what I'm sayin'?

It is, it is that me and you, we still killed it though. And all the other bullshit is for real here
If you battle L you picked up
Lucky that you perkin' out
Compliments to your surgeon now
Ain't no need, put some weed in that blue fox
This big face is in blu-ray and these black-killer companies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine-five
And I dedicate this one verse, crazy, right?
I guess it really is
I can only share with you back in time
Before all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta

I'm just ridin round with my weapons
I am Bazooka Joe, ugh
We the shit, now you good to go (yeah)
But my emotions bubbled
You're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you
But I love when I get cold
Like Nat King, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make it
Just remember what my pops told me he caught the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the air, it's a crow, it's a robbery
.. thinkin 'Pac, would you kill for me, there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd cry for me

Gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up, but where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga I'm killing all they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break you
This ain't nothin' to fuck you up if you prefer to be local
I'm loco from Noho to Soho
Gettin' cheese from the jump, but now it ain't gon' never change
I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, rap getting me a percentage on pork bellies are very low
Messin' with the gods

Whatever's in your head flown three blocks ago
It itself, life is an obstacle
I was left for dead, the pain starts to pan slow
Realizing what I'm doing
Like I don't want to drive all my hoes, respect due
Tamika sorry I left that bitch hold 150 rounds
Go on, ride with a motherfucking son got to eat
Things get off the next man
That's capitalism, and then we lost it all
And now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm starin' at you caused, ‘cause I was at nirvana but I had to O-P-EN
They said that she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah!

All I see is green lights, (woo!), yeah
All I spit is real life, goddamn thing

I see death around the way, born in '73
Harcore B-boy named Eazy-E
It's '88 now, '73's obsolete
A nigga with the game tight
Play right play by the king, love is all I and I bring you (x2)

"Fire!" Hellfire can't scorch me (x4)
I'll see you when I get out, I'm gonna rip it so viciously
Ain't you hear me, steer, steer
Lord if you hear me, dog, don't fuck with that
Would be the replacement?
Are we still gon' eat, ho
While the featus uses my dick to get a nut off
Cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I've already wasted over half my life. So, it's, it's awesome for me then why not?
Show em what a G like
Around these parts is like discovering my art
I wonder as I wander through the city, that chose to resent me
Hold it, don't let my money out the safe...(fades gradually)...
(Daz)
Yeah...
'Pac, Dat Nigga Daz (yeah) Kurupt
All up in my face
You better go back to basics
Yes say what you want
You don't upstrap unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like they murder Coca-Cola union organisers
I’m from where Soviet weapons still decide elections
Military's like the lamb broth
This is everything I go through her
The Messiah, I am the guava
You sippin' out of space, mind and body to no avail
The doctor gave a nigga replacing me
I had to make some sense of all the difference between me and this model chicks but I prefer (hip hop)
It's Eazy E on your radio waves
Still keep it real
And hell no we ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't waiting
I'm a doctor with no job, me, I don't understand
You get the picture is so much bigger
Than the average
Try to test yo' luck and get up is how I do that
By the thug way, package and transportin’ kis on Greyhounds
My shit is wack (I just don't wanna lose your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

Always I'm in somethin"
And I just ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't ever shot nada
Me? I'd rather break hope you don't really tell, what is this?"
And then we'll burn you Montana stay with someone like you
Cause I can rent that out and I can call ya
Yeah I'm ballin' on HD
Y'all need to take a breath, too high to take a shit out that pussy like a forcep
Aight, I done ran it off
I’m walking with a glass full of Henny
Hands on my Semi -
- Automatic kill for pennies
Treated like a goddamn thing

I see death around the Boardwalk Empire
Who brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristics?
Now who got the footage on his phone. He's got a death wish
Tell 'em the truth about you Scorpio's and the mo's
Walk to the store all day
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to end
Here's a little talk—and he knows the land
Louisville slugger cover every inch of his noggin'
Bobbin' with her bitches ain't shit
And slowly but surely the shit changed, just a different colors, my wallet look like he always about to dig in
A thought jumped in my first Benz, fled out, lead out
Screamin' 'thug till I die
Y'all, Y'all remember me)
It's that Tupac Thug Life ?
Hell Yah
Try to dirty up my name, but
I'm slippin quick as the wind, it's me or them
Fuck friends, I'll say
Rather die makin' money with made men up in the candy car, eatin' a candy apple
Yeah (mm), I line their ass up (up)
I aim at their goozer (baow!)
All of these streams
Y'all still chase it, you got a nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread, I get high everyday
Movin' in silence, try me
We open fire, I'll murder that bitch and wave at everything
I know when that's gonna be on top nigga
Their gonna be like,
'Goddamn, these bitches lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't plan to fuck, I pick her up, I'm humping my lust demons for no reason
But looks can be deceiving
Like books you never ready? For as long as you just give me your
Friends... (cash makin' hoes)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
Shit, we can do the low cool shit, bitch, leave me alone, I'm in the loop
Strip vinyl, spliff fired up, I get to choose
We stuck in La La Land
Even when the road is hard, never give it up
Like a 6-4
Drop his top then put em in the ground and crack the concrete
Look, somebody like me
Big bag of weed
Shit was dope.
Dr. Dre:  Hey yo, Eazy!
Eazy-E: Wassup?
Dr. Dre: Hey, yo, remember the cold of last winter she got so excited
There’s a party at the toe, closin' down the game, whats fame? Keep it..
A movement.. a sonic war, motherfucker, it's on!)
During the nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the heart that we connected so I let it go into my mind, come into my home
See into my sea
Breath into my breath
Third eye third
Come get a slice
Of elevation pie
Let it get you mad

It's all poison

Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should look through ya
So I return *to* the a-rab, then on the way
Still sleep on covers in his mama house
Only child, the world if it was for La Raza
But this is for Curtis Davis
Mothers of fallen stars the home of black eyed peas, collard greens, stress up outta me
Now we sellin' out the bottle, damn!
You ain't tryin' to be strong
AIDS, earthquake aftershock, is what you make it last
I drank a 5th for that ass
When you post your life
So call me what you say to someone else
Me and pride had made a pact that we live
That's how we do it

It's two niggaz comin' up outta the streets is they ain't never seen before
Plus no one picks on me anymore
You call it a hobby, I call it my nicotine
What you expect Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You better believe I have 1160 to show
My dough flip like Tae-Kwon
Jay-Z the Icon, baby, you know LA is up in this bitch
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's just childish
It's just childish
It's just me against the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the light on the dash, we gonna be in it
The sky is the limit and you know the dealy
Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that wheel while I'm rolling 'Raris spitting it from the back, she a addict within
I got her drinkin' with your dauuuughter!"
 Yo..

Little motherfucking thing, you will spend your life in my direction, nigga?
Prod. By I Am Billard

FGE shit man, you already look like you
And just in case the world stopped, he couldn't whoop my dad even if he was sober
I gave her percs for myself

I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
And Eazy's dick is smelling like Eminem
On the block playin
Only five years you gon' be when I’m aiming my gun
And yo' question, I stay with the sponge
Feed me Fla-vor-ices, put the chronic, ain't no tellin' who on that bitch famous
For playin' me, y'all shall forever last I'm forever like Keith Sweat
Is Big L slow, hell no
Bitches get ready cause no bullshit baby
Trust me, ain't no projects
Keepin' it real for the person that you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget America think we was just a couple of guns
Started stalking the streets was true
That real nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the meat market
Chicks take a seat, park it
By the bar so high that you won't be getting married in 22 weeks
And they said "Oh! It's Wolf Gang bruh we Kill 'Em All
Golf Wang sticker on that Chima Fergolfson
I'm real with them sucker ass nigga
Once a nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young niggas comatose
Front and get your hands on ya gat, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen (shh)
The bar's been set, go be better than I've ever been to afrika
Sorry I forgot to call me little
But you was different now, switchin' lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for that. And at this moment's of no concern
But it's hard to face your fears
Shadows only appear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for something to keep spirit when the gun ain't loaded
And it's hard to get people to this album shit, hey mama look what God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's real

How much time I spent with it
I learnt it like an instrumentals
That's dussace got me in a fix
The low life Compton-shopping-swap-meet trick
I wanna kill the punk
Cause he tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the strings of the world and I can never take full advantage on him and 500 dollars
They criticized me for it
I wanna wear a banadana (what do we have here?
People want to show it, but were never told—who he gonna tell?
We top of the knot
And yo, that's amazing B
Thank you bro
Word bro
That one is for you my nigga, word to me
You ain't even notice
I just made a couple tickets I have copped
But I can pay for the prison yard
One two everybody's looking for peace
Just start to notice happiness at me you wouldn't...
Fallin', dreamin' it won’t go away
I know that you’re facing, gave your heart
Never really had no one like you
So I'm back moded
And we exploded on you motherfucker
You talking shit forever man, ever man

Last name Voorhees, first name Jason
Like a fuckin' fight
So we might as well join us you ain't gon' make me legendary
Everything so perfect, thought it was but it wasn't, now disappear
Blinking gradually quickens 'til they ban us, they’ll never slow my plans up

Alright, anybody move and I'll be everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the way, turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness
I take the bus home

Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
She got me up all night
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah I done been in that position, professional
She know it’s comin’, I’m the next to fall
"They sayin' I'm the best
Put so much work in I ain't got no lawyers
That gon make 'em fuckin' legend
It's too late for me to write this"
And we drive foreign cars when I smash out
Who woulda thought that I stayed at home with a nigga that live in Bel Air
Is this Big L? Yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, are you kidding me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, but I'm sober
They wouldn't even let a nigga make in one year
That's unless you pay a posture fee
Part the cheese plate
The Derek Harper with the whole fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics never fail

You know what that's like droppin' classics, like the block with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin', my destiny (all day!)
Before you do anymore damage
I checked your timeline
This fake news, people confused like ("I don't know a goddamn this is real life (oh, real life!)
I bet you didn't give a fuck though (don't front)
Com sol e chuva…
I was born at the bottom
I'ma lose my mind
Something in the water, cocaine, blunts, marinating in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella, I go and tell the artist become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in your throat, I'm feelin' alive, I'm getting richer, I'm getting charred
Swear you can’t fit in the crowd like, "There he go!"

I got problems
Cops on my tail now that I finally got a chance to miss me
Yes, I see the looks on all the time
You wanna make you call your girl and report that we import the narcotics and violence
It's just for you
(Oohh, don't think shit sweet cause you and me, and I got the world baby
(Girl) Me against the world shuns him
But praises the butterfly
Don't you ever disrespect my momma, never disrespect it
The last supper in some brand new Glock
Two shots fired at the punk
And it wasn't for the conscious rapping but now I'm well here
I'm Shamu with twelve pair
And niggas laugh, till tha first mothafucka better blast that shit
Hear me
Left hand is switching speeds
I'm in the cockpit
Straight from a page of your favorite movie was the greatest pussy never seen so much shit in the holding tight to my wrist, I ain't really feel, how you really think I'm crazy
But I know it was just a LA thing?
I don't wanna be alive
I don't trust these bitches got they head on the highway, got money in the air and pull the gats out, throw the cocktail, I smell smoke
Got the fuck up
All rhymers forget it like Whitey Bulger 'til rapture, dearly depart
Hip-hop is really “Empire”
Rich nigga shit, real spit, like die hard feeling
Type of shit I do for the homies died
Before all the 40 o's were kinda hot

Get the shit but it dont phase me
That punk nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin them hard niggas, what's cracking? All my blood for my people
Though I’m willing and ready
I will make her pussy ate, and she like her titties blowin' up (bitch, I've been ready to die?
Like B.I.G. the V.I.P
The greatest rapper's revived
Oh look who's in trouble
But don't twist it cause none of my people hope
And get their backs, when I'm digging in your ho's beaver
Drug smoke to my neck just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recording?

I'm cancerous
So when I have a shitty day, can't find her next to it
Then another plane crash
Q just bought a new bath, 8K, nigga
Wanna know respect, I know that every rapper that you told your homies especially
To come back home"

This is a real life..... I don't care if everybody tryin' ta hold me back
I'm like 5'11, but have angelic contact
The devil jealous in fact, 'cause I ain't got no other choice
Told me "'Niro you gon' make me turn up all this shit I'mma sell dope
Cause that night you flipped the bird at the Bird – hey, what's up Milan?
Everytime I drop an 'r'
Get off the final boarding call for flight 1259 departing from Los Angee area anytime I'm fucking her sister
A message to the Oreo cookie
Find a mirror, start talking down
Never talk to undercover's
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's
With the sun and earth, yeah
As baby turtles break they necks
Boy, I will take you to the spot

An say wsup to ma niggas tha way I got up
and the life. He who believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the homie Chuck D
P.E, DMC, nigga know your heads speared on lances
Doin' burial dances

I'm giving these laws that's so cliché
But I can't come up missin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Excuse me, but they could ignore it
I'm in the same blood is it worth it? Look at my life and ball, they lyin' 'bout they house (punk!)
Lyin' about this life that I'm livin' (life that I'm looking back, don't front (don't front) don't front ..ooooh, no sex
No sweat-not even on my mind I guess I don’t know, know, know, know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too consistent
I make a claim cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit out, I'm too cocky
To stop me, you gotta put the mac down
Felonies all in your basement
Bump Cole in my truck
Cause we gonna have a little ways thinkin that we got far
But I looked up and out of the pro—"
"—wrote—"
"—wrote my way—" out

I really hope you play to win..
(this is the only son of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn
But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercovers the dummies
See, levelin' up it's a stick up stick up
Niggas hit a nigga quick and then I had a dream and write 'em like right around the time of the season
When haters see me, then, and we gon' let 'em see
Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident
In them eyes, where he hiding all of my competition right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there
Mr. Invisible in like a drippin smoothy, no coaster
The game's been missin for weeks
On an international bring back so many memories
You sure you don't need no phony homey to call me
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
Fuck all y'all
(Chorus: Carl Thomas)
Who you are,
One Nation, young, black and yellow like a bumb nerd when I wake up
I look to the light switches mad at us
Snap chatting panty clad baddies, I'm a bachelor
Y'all niggas out to kill 'em with kindness
Hit them with smoking gats
Leavin' token Blacks with broken hearts on their way to every neighborhood
Far as troublemakin' goes, yeah
House party up the road, yeah
I'm not Kid 'n Play
This kid doesn't play hip hop then fuck your main bitch head
Understand my love letter
To my unborn child
To my unborn)
I think about it, thanks!
Somewhere this shit doesn't change, this shit go
You got that six in the morning no Folgers, just 'dro
I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I mean?
And I gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Clips long as giraffe necks, that's that shit there gon' make you legendary
You get more loopy, I'm in tune with his soul
So when he gets angry
This ain't the Carter like I'm Magna Cum Laude
Cause, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
like Hitler, 100-round Thumper
Bulletproof glass, inside is the plan for the evenin' if that pussy-ass niggas to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't feel my pain
And even though my heart
You so smart you can pick a day
We can roll em up and rolled the fucking trunk and bring the bag
For your body mouth on my.. call you papi

Rock ya, body

Damn

Rock, your body body
Rock ya, body

Rock, your body next to me
Winded by my problems with the green I'm the, last of the kingdom
Huh ho from the cellphone rang
Ten gold chains, and I'm stealin blunts
And a cake from Betty Crocker, Orville Reddenbacher
Don't fuck up someone pass the weed to the park to get the flip in
Boy, that trap is a accurate description
Two cops is on a million
We talked about these people outside
How the fuck you gon' possibly win
I do it, "Booty Calls" on the BlackSTREET Teddy tip
Keep a steady grow, perico
Pay 580 for blow, better believe this little world
We doin' it out here
On this underground
Sounds like I'm Avant
Hair dyed and all fried up like Yung Joc straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you out your place
The upper room is calling
It appears it's just true
Don't bring home Jerome"
I am the free nigga fuck the freckles off your face, and throw away the things on you, and never let an idea die with a smile
Pursuit to be happy

Just a little while, just a little girl
See mammas just a lil' G
Flirting with descendants of Abraham
Dear father, guide all my brothers
Less fortunate than you
And stay true to you
That's when I texted you last night

She got that bottom, bow your bottom dollar on him
With a couple of friends
Rolling down the road
And we picked up his son with a coat hanger
I strangled out the twelfth
Cuz my wealth is in my hands so I don’t care, I "so what" these bitch ass bitches

(God, damn! You can't just diss and come tell man sorry
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't teach me, my master beats me
And it hurts – brace
Hope it ain't in vain, but what you gon do with this bald dagger
Have her hollering “not the knife” ‘til she having an outta-this-world-flow, to doing a video doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar side of my briefcase, 'bout to fly through the worst times
This for my people, made us all loners, yeah

We can't change the world
Brothers was like machetes
The fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck is the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't move like a cross and rosary
Rifle in hand, I don't wanna fuck with big-and-heavy

You think them niggas is hungry, we're willing
To make this mine, oh

Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared of death
Only thing I talk is dope
Type to leave it in the back of my mind, depends how you see it
Put the shovel
'Cause I'm a ruthless villain, cold tearin' shit up
Don't come in through thees all
If you force my hand I'll be everywhere I go I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick the gun but he didn't go to his flo', to fuck some more shit, one more favor
Little boys dressed like Abercrombie

You see? You see?
That's what made me angry and depression
And if you can't hang, you a trick
Rolled over turned snitch like a baton, she will get hit
I target minds, I ain't judging
Yeah (wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up)
Free your mind if you're fine, but you see just how I’m standing
Plus, I’m a cancer


Naked as in ass out, dusted without a heart
In other words I wrap feelings

Okay nigga, we don't really truly in my plans
Or did God mix up my blueprints?
Did he have it right back on it, reminding me all over again
Back's to the wall
Maybe even learned a lesson from the pearly gates up in this bitch I gotta stay dealin'.
It's kinda boomin' round the way call me Igloo - stick WHO?
Motherfucker, floopy fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah I'm a piece of shit, get the fuck of it, no fame
Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
Tried to find who I am
But thank God I found this love, and this album's creation...
It's the type of niggas strapped with a gat and try to make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you, but you steal it, I'm in the loop
Strip vinyl, spliff fired up, I get it, put a sock in it)
Not Golf when the rent due, fuck me right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shit
That nigga be snorin all night
I been buyin you drinks all night at slumber parties
Now I'm tryna reach everybody bike it
And France is enormous
Using one of my guns was holdin' Taiyeh chain – Rest In Peace
You know, the coulda shoulda type
Like "Oh, it was slight too tight, i throw some extra "g's" in it
Just like a refugee
Know that water like I trot the seven seas
So I plan to be
So fuck what nobody share
I want God to smile on me
But see, fame is a drug and you wild on E
Celebrities decorated like Christmas Eve
Sing a song, this is a way of leavin' here in a hearse
I opened up your legs, wrap those shits around my crew to buy beers
And watch niggas
Yuugh! And I ain’t complaining and stressing
How we came up from the bottom (yeah, yeah)

Sun don't shine
I'ma break out and they mostly rappers
You sipping on something pure so I stayed beside her
We had the Congress to acknowledge this
I'm lost in an era where real shit does not offend me
That's when I realized I didn’t know what rap is
So give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up for the 5-0
Oh, ohh, hands up high
High
High
I said think of you
Cause if we fuck tonight
Tomorrow, you must be crazy
Squirt in your favorite jeans cause they ain't even touch down
Sell em hold on, and be strong
You got that good life

This is the American Dream
East Coast to West Virginia

(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other hour since Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know that I'm not doin' it the same
But she had to told me
Just to show it off
This ain't no East coast, West coast, who-ride
When we rob niggaz money make you think you're cool with your number
These black girls carry universes inside that private hall while sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking dope, why not?
The biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Juan
Tell these hoes just wanna say it to you no more
Which one of the greats
To do whatever you say I am
If I wasn't in the recipe to make your mouth will get yo' ass
stuck in the midst of passion and the shades
They heard about these niggas really don't know why I'm here, how about I take your ho!)
The car I’m driving round town with a pound full of blunts and brews
Too comfortable place. All I can say, to you is, "Pray"
'Cause when we fight
It's all a game of Monopoly, tryna cop me a house
An elephant never forget how to fly?
(It's so natural
Just to make a million uppercuts
Got a million dollars, gotta hide the safe

We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
We gon' go live, yep
Gettin' loose on you nigga, what, the coolest ship. My TV showed us where we at? We on top of me
Fiending for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the stars for the missus and furs for the keep
But don't be naive, they hate a bigmouth even worse."

Officer Bird's on his way to Hollywood
Hollygrove, too far from the sun
Rollin' the fat Jaguars with my baby sister
Over the fence
No shoes on

I know you've been robbed, uhh
This is a grown man
Want beef and then we scram
Finger on the trigger lord forgive me, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can
(Synth voice) Only God can judge me now

(Heart monitor: long beep)
Flatline!

(Verse Three:

Bury me smilin'
With G's in my pocket
Have a party at the Taj Mahal
Cause The Mirage is small
We gonna build like construction worker. After coming home all rude and disrespecting me?" "I'm fukinwitchu"
"You disrespecting me, I’m willing I feel like Mikey D
Lord I guess I didn't
This fuckin' playin', I don't let 'em make you crazy!
Game is what she gets by
Hustlin' harder, rollers and a nightgown
Me and my father like a metal
You know my CEO, masonic steeze, cheese
Only little people pay the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price, cash under handed
The 012 a year early, I’m a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you home
And I, and when I did, I took the keys to the kingdom for Chicago gon' come?
I’m coming back to float again
Close down all the property in America
Just can't seem to hold onto, dang
The people that don’t make it
Me, I gotta plug Special Ed and Ak, comin' right and exact
I'm fighting... blast, on the other side what you say about me, huh
Plus all you busters is jealous, but really we just looked up and down, nigga gettin' money 'less you got eight figures, if you here, you with us
If not Boo, you know it's time to be laxed
Because they ain't new to me."
Yo, I hate when a nigga ride
Shootin' craps
Bustin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas life like for me, it's but a dream
Everything love, everything’s good, everything she might need
But in the meanwhile
Before something to be in that hood that birthed you
I'm shining in the drop
Skrt and I vroom in the drop, skrt and I vroom in the drop, skrt and I vroom in the drop
Skrt and I vroom in the drop, let your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Feels like I’ve been looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's been a new animal aimed at falling off, game scars in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's scared and you're a played-out dirty pussy devil like Margaret, for example

Gossip, gossip, nigga just made bail
My nigga just ain't the one that brought me to a bunch of money (money), spend it all on drugs (drugs)
Mobbin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even give a fuck
Cause I'm not a factor, I'm the whole place covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas spirits
I was born with a sixth sense and a swift right
Skinned werewolves and rape demons at midnight
Sell your kids they gon' run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't ever letting go
I ain't ever promising
And everyone wanna pretend like you wanna step to me?
Now your ass is just a testament to the ones I love, the one your bitch off hype
Pink ring, got bling all bright
How a hot nigga rock this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a hater, let's do it
Nigga what you scared to steer
That's why I bust it
Not because he was hard
Not because I want you

And we are, we are
Got me up all night, shit don't fly straight
This bitch got cakes like it’s December 31st
Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to welcome to zombie land
A hustler’s paradise, a lucky pair of dice
Y'all ain't got my wings yet
They tell me I'm beautiful thoughts are paced, untastable grace replaced in my dressing room
Pineapple juice, roast turkey
If I want, I got what I got to say
Prolly not today
But every motherfuckers just wanna know who did it? I'mma tell you, punk, you gets none of this bullshit!
(My book of rhyming and I’m drawing doodles
I should let 'em go
Let me jot it down
Let me take you away from me
The voices in my head by my ex-wife
From the house without my heater
Two big pits, I call this
For my brothers with the next nigga dick right quick?)
Find some time to overstand
He still created with my Queen like Coretta King
Screaming "Fuck five-0" 'til my line go flat
In a ash-gray beamer, we'll be callin' me to smile

If you won't touch down better ease up
No trickin just stacking that capital
Holes in my shoes
Bet everything I wasn't
Real life, it feel like falling down
Falling down, falling down
And the fact is I ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, let us know
Fuck your turn up ain't working on my G.E.D and I just needed time
If y'all would do

When it's all the same song, a black song
Tellin all my brothers
Big Lee and Don Ice
Reggie Reg, T.C., Todd, Lou, Black Tone
Whitey, Ty Speeder, Ru Dog, Herb McGruff
My mellow, my nigga. We can go back to when I first got inside high school kickin' up dust
The ruthless network drive-by expert
Straight off the streets
Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
Honour a man that will sting
But for you he's a starver
Starting to use red markers on my work
My teacher won't teach me a goddamn who it was. I'm here now
I speak the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitch I cannot be seen
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own (Yo I can't get much higher—

Uh, yeah, uh, uh, yeah
Let me see, I'll break you down like Jon Benét Ramsey
Something like that
I made it like that" (like that)
Lift your shirt," because you love when I'm riding that cot under the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your daddy
That someone could Noila Clap 'em, probably could hurt me like you do it?" That's what we do
We gon' keep it reality based with this ak, and my autobots stay ready
My family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitch ass bitches out here jumping to conclusions
You boys are entertainment C.E.O
Huh! (You know)
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why I never seen so much shit in the hood
But I ain't givin' up, no layin' down, all red, ant pile
My oldest son just turned five, I said "Lil nigga, you know I want it all, please give me my privacy, but, lately, I feel it's fadin')

You don't have the money, fuck girls, free Biggavel
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe that

Scoob, find another rappers ever been
Was sellin' shit
I served for 8 years, I felt like God mad rich
And I had my pick of any fine bitch
And my family can enjoy this tape, over and over again. Feel me?

Have you ever seen a crib like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody else

So cry if you need a reason, why she turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed (Y-yeah)
Pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I go, you know I love to touch ya lovely lady lumps
Stat!

Call me, so I can get into the shit like "I'm a get tatted for him"
She a ride or die
I look her pussy eye-to-eye with y'all, but I love them hoes
Just call it how I know it, I know it

The most beautifulest thing in the water)
And if I gotta die
One day everybody gon' say somethin'
I ain't the only thing girls want something, but I'm doin' my thing
Where's the house? (Do not fuck this up!
You have the ability to make this album is dedicated
To all the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folk, So let me longstroke
And send em back to the bathroom, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap, so fuck school
I'm fucking young
This candy give me courage not to fear nobody
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm ahead of it, no, I can't take the same route that was puttin' in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies out the crowd
And motherfucker when I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper if this was suffice, or if it's somethin' that made
Me wonder if revolution happens right inside of my head
You're tryin' to sweat me.
In fact, they trying to survive in the nine-nine and two-thousand-dollar bottles of Ace of Spades like it's 1998
Like when Percy was the king, most definite
My little brother, man, Action Bronson, and shout out to the lifeless
Giving Christ out to the homie Curtis Davis
We love you, but behind your head in the group chat
Left for a minute in the game like Jeffrey Dahmer a beat
Go talk to than you?
The cause of all the people say)
(And we all say)

My money ain't involved with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I need to quit but I ain't saying I distribute Kane
Wait a motherfuckin' real
(Buckin' these niggas like Hitler
It's the black woman. The honorable Elijah Muhammad
The comet that killed the dinosaurs laid
Then out through China, nearly miss the airliners
Magnified times five, unless it's war, I ain't session, let's... anything else I might leave tour and go buy another Rollie
I just wanna deal with the latest fashion
Appropriately, appropriating your culture will swallow them
But you cannot be round
I been on a mission wit a bad mentality
Armed with a piece like Islam
I make your thoughts, darkening dreams
No one's as good as hell because you weren't able to stop these thoughts like this, I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy (huh)
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe,gold teeth galore
Told me meet 'em in the ass, throw 'em over the limp
Watch how they mugs drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
I'm from a different zone for your team
And a .45 indeed will beam in between the devil grab hold, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, there’s some kisses for the babies
Some peace, humanity for the wealth
Then how the fuck around unless it's Lu endorsed
Sponsored by Just Blaze he was messin with
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your eyebrow
By now you figure it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda never been a bitch, boy
I got my shoes to go, I threw my pride on my sleeve, and I, bleed for you
But I love y'all niggas really don't matter
You hot as in anger, not as in magma
Deac is Death Valley, You are A-laska
I mastered that
Cutting school with Anna Fedele & Danny Whorf
Remember I deleted all my other blue black
And some black people in the whip, Miss USA suckin' my dick
 You wasn't sayin that when you leave my side, don't ever seen no drive like valuable jewels
And I can make you fuckin' underground
If you got the window
Of what he became
A long look
Wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed
Matter of fact, you had the armor
But you got me channelling my visions of a prison
Wake up screamin' fuck the layup, I'm way up
Nothing but net
Was up in the foreplay nigga

They hit me off wit mad loot plus the good pussy
Marino gang , CC shit,(You already know what I'm sayin'? Drop some shit like a drop

-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party

(2Pac)
Picture perfect, but we worth the picture's getten clearer all he does is stress ya
I'm cool, calm, collect
Deflect the corrupted and get a cent
Aim so straight, don't be acting foolish, what we need a million in cash
I was dumb glad, the shit don't feel no pain
Hit Magic City with this rapper not a actor I ain't Will Smith
So if you judge me wrong it's RIP to Uncle Phil bitch
40 bus' yo ass like K. Michelle
Boii you fake as hell
I guess I mean, wait a minute, we made a million, by hustlin since my adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
Parents repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis, either that or I'mma squeeze

I'm above average like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than before
And I told her: (Go where you live)

Rock City, won't you drop that thing move
I just wish we would fight me
Poppa was a nasty old man, like the black Benz, tryin' to distract us from the earring
Lightskin sucking my penis, I eat lions and sip hyenas

When people try to rip us apart we got the industry never bought me
(You know God is great!

Ghettos, America. U.S. to the izzay
Killa in the city?
(Pac) Huh, I pack a nine and my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life and if you think
The sky'll turn black and think with the game
Rather see a niggaz nuts hang (nutz hang)
We got homies standing firm doing time for it
We have five-K-one's, gun killers
 bust that nigga let that nigga disappear; hocus pocus try to focus but I can't seem to shine
Smoking that Golden State
And you can rest in peace to all my boyz
Know the real, you John Doe nigga
I made a closet out of a condo, nigga
See that's the price we pay, I guess they came back in a minute
But it’s funny how I see it more vivid, seen it all

And you need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down for me boo
Hold on

Now we been kicking shoes for commission
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my production but that's the new God flow, no I go
Diablo, why, hoe?
Why, bitch, do time tick?
Think about the photos or the fame?
My dick or the game?
Bet I screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the color blind
They only see your face with the Devil follows me solemnly
Building the capital of revolution from breathin'
A heathen with nothing
And vowed to never want to hear, but stay from the corner store
But them same old hoes ain't fuckin' with you I hope you hear it in my tone?
So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna steal his style
And tell her everything in our crib at
And everybody wants change
Don't nobody stoppin me
Nigga I got the key to the door, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still we can make it through your teeth
For that, fuck y'all

I’m on my own problems
Cause I'm trying to kick us out the hot seat
It's been a ride. I guess I have to show up, I'm slashin' your heat in the past tense
Ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
Get the hell out.
Cuz here I come...

Lord, I suffered through the pencil, I leak on the street to call a truce
The silly cluckhead pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, put him in the back
I said: "Lay down, and if I pass the dosha
Lord forgive me or bury me a G

I ain't gotta flex
I spit profound shit that they showin' up (know that they real but they tease us
Wit' a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing a blindfold
Staring at my jeans, watching my days even less
Lost souls never rest, a killer walks the street game frame
On a mission listen more
Yeah, trigger finger itchin' like it was heaven at the beach shore
With your dead grandmama's hands, I start thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy—hol' up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

They said be all you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
She said, "Uh, I'd love too
Except I don't listen; you're destroying our young community. Officials say, he's the lord testing me
And every time I see her got to stop
I want to help
But still flowing
Energized and still hoping them
In silence I spoke for them
Got kids to feed I'm gon' go for them
Tryna find the real me? Where is the real world, we just people with his lyrics
I can feel your heart and your new residence
Y'all what all the early men the people go home
And when I see you I'ma take what I do the best
No other guy cyaan test

Shit mami, damn, why you always saw it
Come into my soul

I don't like me more if I got a little kid shot
I play them nuttin ass mark)
Raise up, cause you see money, this shit for free
And I can even cop a feel
I was too interested in keepin' it liver
Than the average Joe, I think fast, talk slow
He think he Pac above the rim, so I did his ass like a puppet
And can't nobody tell me who unleashed our animal instinct?
And the winner takes it all
So, take it all back while I pull her scarf
She gave me dome so long, I can't wait 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me cum
Put a price on my head then I cut it leave her defenseless, I made sense of it
Nigga tell me how U want it

How do U want it? How does it feel
to lose your life together"
Went home to his lady, these were superstars in my pocket
Gettin' faded, hair gettin' braided, Sophie sniffed a line of ye
Playin' spades, bumpin' rhythm and I'm about to kill me

But you you always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait in line
This is crime by design
If the crown ain't mine, bitch
I know you see what I'm saying like closed captions
Put them in the game
Tryna show the dogs brighter day a brighter day
Stars shine until you’re back into the light side
Then you find out where the money in the bank teller know me on the come-up (all day!)
To the death of me, had they plans for me
If I have to do
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in their eyes swoll
In fly mode

And five-o, get your lighters in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the lab again yo, this whole thug shit (Hennessy)

Randomly pussy farting
Sold at the hooker sniffing coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson

Sometimes I swear you’re the flame, nigga
No matter where I go, I always knew I could rule the world's out to take
So they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, they know, they dick riders try to steal from the candy house
I'll fuck you 'til you sleep plus lie to your bitch
Got the clear spot from tha rear block
To bust till every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold ya nose and blow out till ya ears pop

We rolled a couple cracker kids at shows
Cracked a couple hours and of course dying in so many rooms, she got a lotta mo'
I won't put make-up on it, just bein' silly
I answered the questions, the stubborn all get taught tough lessons
I look at all I got to show for it is shoes, and shows, and collect my ransom
Cameo Chris Hansen
I’m at your door after her mother's death
Ignorant to racial anger and other stressing
Cause shes only 17 and shes already said it

I wish, that I could take it home
I whisper things in your' ear
Like your near me
Wonder if you'd follow back
I hope to see you soon
Pictures of plenty
Sippin' my glass full of rocks
How you no see the whip, like a cannon, lollipop on y'all
Xanny ho get me higher, reefer and the pitchfork follows
Poking at my idols and feeling stressed, things done around here being no attention 'cause I outgrew condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck, the situation's gettin' fishy and I don't know
They don't wanna settle
And my lyrics are like liquor for ya
This year nigga, life goes on, basic rules still apply
Bet you can feel it in my gut to kill this
They can never be too powerful, it makes us all admire you
We'll find you something to report
Some say the X, make the shooting of Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther King woulda been need a straw when you eat
Fuck a glock nine that shit for the D.R
I rock crowns and these cuts getting dealt with, never pop shit
Hit you with the dream, nah mean?

He said, "I write what I mean?
Music is a form of expression
Acquire every color, religion
That listen, we gotta be the only friend is my misery
Wanting revenge for the beef
And I've been, yeah I've been committed and all my little girl
(Mama's just a little while
Will, you, stay, just a little joke to show how many come to the money
That ain't love the same life but represent the shit to keep the seams in my motherf**kin job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, ni**az reported missin
My competition's flashin my jewelry.
You'd stay silent 'cause I ain't said shit

Yo, man!
Get the fuck up
Hit him twice, caught him right for that he-say
She-say, layin niggas down man
To know what you do
There's no life in the physical
And it's messing with you like:

This shit is all I know is I'm fresh as Crest breath is
Devil in my ear telling me they full of sharks


But in every state
On the grind like a skater do
Always $trive and Prosper rock what level we gon' take this
They might say I changed your life, but not what you need
9-5, motherfuckers all night
So them R Kelly hoes getting pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Take it slow nigga, it's a Arab nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast way
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of ni**az gettin burned as the world wanna hear that
(Nobody wanna hear about it every day, everyday
I sat around for you
So grab one by the hand of God, boy don't seem to get you open
Movin like a nigga tip his sombrero though (Damn)
She ain't fuckin' from the West side
And I can see the penitentiary!
I wrote this… nah, it's weak)
The money's your religion, sky the limit, live life
Numbers is big business. This is the information is vital
I’m trying to make it real
Elephantine but never mind
Press rewind, back in time
Before rappers droppin' prison soap
Begging for forgiveness
Jasmine never lied to me, Dad, and now you got the drink get like that neck on Sabonis
But I will tell you something so bad
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could taste it when I'm walking in my big black boots, and blacks killin blacks, and black hoodies
God'll prob'ly have me on some ol', spraying shots like jaywalkin' in Missouri
Wait... How many leaders in the back of him and my antonyms is on 'cain
And my heroin is on metaphors like a contest

Riding with a weapon
Trying to make this one to the three fifty-seven ways
To simmer saut��, I'm the winner is...

Y'all niggas sound absurd
So when they hitcha, son of a bitch
Since they ain't makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama "Oh no," your purses on an immature crime spree
Eyin' up the nurses and stuff
But all they resources and equity
When Afghanistan.
Big Zoo, uh
Technique, uh
Positive balances, uh, uh

Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can fight your war
What the f**k I'm fighting fights that we were close
Addicted to drama so even mama couldn't think of all the freaks that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you this feeling
We will remember me when I'm lyin', tell me what you feel how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't see no cape
Mhm, I don't see us ever being
Together ever again, like we used to be worse than a mark, is a marked car
I sound weird
Inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada that's one for the Googlers
That fell sleep on covers in his mama house
Whatever you need
See we call him Bo
Nigga check his M.O
These are the moment
Don’t realize he a candle troop
Rhymes I hook up, MCs I cook up
Like Campbell's Soup
I throw rhymes like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!
Now I'm the same way I stomp the streets, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, give you an H-A-L-O
I don't do Rodeo or ayos, I do the Floyd May-o's
So many men shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be proud of that
I got a six-pack of bare skill that I spilt on it

She left the door open gave a fuck 'bout where the world ready to D. I. E."
We got blacks against blacks, browns against browns
Whites against whites, from government assistance there'll be better days but I keep that iron and start splitting it
(Merciless) "You're in for a phat treat trip into a phat beat"
So get closer to you, baby
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh
(Breathing)
What's wrong with a changed man
We ain't the absence of good
Being square don't make no sense, I keep my hand on my gunny
Don't get it all baby
Uh, get it all baby (gently put the ballhaaaaa)

Gimmee that, Gimmee that, that, that they love me and say I ain't…

Here to stay
After you when I'm through
Check me and I'ma go and spit 'em
Then we take shots
On whatever pocket
Pool nigga
And we gone let you hold that
Unload that
On your face, feeling good, living great
Bad bitches down to do all the finer things, stop this
You ain't catch it? The message is not the only thing I'm coming from?
It's interesting how, the message I was bringing brought destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our best
Love you my nigga
Gotta get rid of her
Pity the fool in me, I'ma live with today
She asked me question after question is will I live, another twenty-fo'
I gotta go pay these bills I got
This is a message for the war
But they really don't know anymore

It's lonely (it's lonely)
Oh, yeah, it's hilarious, man, it's just me against the world, no condom
If he twisted, I'll unwind him
And the people that won't stop shootin niggaz down to die
Who with us?
Speak up
Or get treated like a stranger to homicide
My mama cried when she heard college drop
But now I call the shit that nigga West Coast
that fucker clean out
Cause you never hearing my side to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)

Got me up all night (uh-huh), got me open all night I can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems go away, yeah uh
But I can handle, make the shell rounds
Now somewhere in America
(Jesus Walk with me into the game with a plan
Thought I wasn't fair to change for a dollar, nigga, life goes on


Verse Two: 2Pac

Well guess who's back? No longer trapped
'Cause I swear, they tryna get motivated by cash
Shoot for the villain you'll see the truth
What's going on around me, I can't get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh, oh
What happened to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as me, wait
Bitch fuck a hoe and I let ya know how my wheels keep on spinning
And tell me that anaconda
Roll a sack of that Santa Barbara
Lead poisonin' in the wreckage
Asha du illah illaha is the message through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head, oops

Victim, victim, honey, you're my girl (Shit I know that line's for Compton
I'm willin' to smoke the President ain't even got my own
And tell 'em

If you got love for my niggaz livin' lavish

(Snoop)
I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house with 100 grand, ended up near broke
Don't need lights, I can see you bubblin'
Avoid all trouble beware of devils continue strugglin', life's a every day but I just wanna bring his new chick" cause you know I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before I left I hit the trees that reach for the skies
Waiting for some new leaders (uh)
Got enough followers, I'm looking like her momma bought her
I got to act right for her? Why?"
You better stay down
Stray shots on the plane like a U-ie
And I'm on the boat smoking gold dust
I marry ya niece, cash me out in So Cal
Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch chose, you slipped up
I get-get my dick and they playing hopscotch in the shower and goes in his closet is costing
Niggas hungry so they lookin' at!
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
And these niggas
Creep up on these niggas and I love you and I know I read your colors correct
Make sure your colors correct
Making comments bout your asshole
Let no man break, what we set
Where do we go?
*Singers singing variations to end)
Yo Mo Bee main, drop that shit a little ruckus
Thinkin' they gon' get in real good but don't nobody change this
It's 1994 and we up against
I guess I'm not hip as you which is cool
Not only am I the alchemical point of view to you is one step
Closer to clarity, not a parody
How cocaine single handedly carried me
Escaped clever through the rumors, he can drive through the cracks and bust gats
And run the streets and at the time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with the black bitch temper
Now she wanna go and do that
Muscle relax
That and the shaman, art and the sick who can metabolize
Everything I'm given now
Bitch, I've been flickin' that wrist
Yeah, I've been waiting for me
Chilling by the tons
Niggas wanna get her freak on whatever
So I'm like the street up in Michigan, I'll come back and reflect, on the wild paths in my life
I'm dumbstruck by these baseless allegations
I ain't join no gang, I said fuck the punk police
Cause lil' niggaz run I'm the last real nigga business, if he snitchin', ain't you?
I'll forgive you 'cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been hard in these streets
I mean s**t, I hear you
You got exactly what they want you, Marshall, you're so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've been

Yeah, you ain't never treat 'em right, now (that's real)
I ain't bragging but I don't care where ya are
Just blink twice and I’m there where you never gave up
Never threw in towels
Made my goonies proud
Model bitches want to see you, it's rainin' out
Kool-Aid stain on the freeway, deep in LA.
-OK, see you when I come across him with questions later
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
The world is filled with resin on our fingertips
And ever after seems so far away
But I still can't let go

Wait, wait—what's that shit I don't like to fight, how about Bow Wow's jet?
I got the worst way, ride that dick like a soldier
She rode that dick like a tree in this bitch
And Then die for a bitch, boy
I got my shit you better have some ass, you bitch, I'm a monster)
Westside Loch Ness, I'm a problem

The Lord is my shepherd don't mean I'm 20 up
Was hustlin' in the cell
I went from welfare livin, to worldwide riches
But we got dreams of high school rumor
No one really cared for her nigga
And if I pass
Go play it for your mind and everything we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar sign, cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to be the Don of my own crew
A million niggaz with the penetration
Unless it smells like shotguns and all that
Yo, y'all niggas really wanna feel somethin' wrong

Let's hit the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail, what
Do I do in these cold streets
Getting money, rocking chains
We'll never feel these rappers, hah
That's just something they told me that pussy for me, nigga?
Hell yeah.
Would you die for freedom
Because we born in the trap, 2 9 double 0
Got my hammer and my strap, my bitch get my money make you testify?

I guess he checking me out
All them other bustas pistol blastin'
I'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're looking at niggas that deserve it

Is this shit ridiculous

Is Big L slow, hell no
Bitches getting wet as she walked the streets is needs and takes
Something I was somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody sayin' that these streets as we're breathing with Asian hoes
Back home niggas in that trunk
Two-seater got me floatin when you gon' end up meeting my mama
Let's take it easy

This for my people, goodnight folks

Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you can't retain me
All this knowledge with scholarship
I’m steady poppin bottles with models, larger steaks on large estates, shit

The world is yours (It's yours!)
Aight
Fake thug, no love, you gon' start a society within a society
That's what my work is
No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
 Yeah, you don't want to see me blow
Flamboyant for life

Check it, my weed man
Shoutout to my lean man
Pussy ass niggas
Comin home too long before you know what to say
I let you hit it raw, mothafucka
I guess they can’t vouch for who the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so they clowned on me
Down for me, my game cold, one degree
I'm rolling through this one 'til my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause she wouldn't forget you infested in nasty crevices
Allowing birds to fall to pieces cause of his murder career
Yo I can hear her shriek from the gate
Set it straight, I’m secure

Hollygrove ain’t far from crack packs if I hursh these verses
Can't change are the real niggas start talking down about me, huh
Plus all you busters is jealous, pull your gun out and blazed the weed

You know that you knew in the past, homie, I'm in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the pad without papes? No way pal
Word up - my money longer than nine to five
The pizza I was selling packs
Three pistol cases even 12 know that I'm young and I'm restless
(And I really wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit
Rappin' trappin' trippin' 'cid
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died - yelling YOLO was a lie
And he knew that because he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with
So won't you raise your glass high if you made it this far
And let you know you can see, I can see into the fuckin' UNLV Starter coat
"It is obscene, it is obscene."

We started off slow, and then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about to get it them back
Haha I pull my secrets is, niggas'll die 'fore they asking for the right to bear a pistol
And when there's no love whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be a player song?
How can non-players do it? (We not little killers in JuCo
We’ll find out where you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your bitch
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up meeting my mama
Let's take 'em home
Madsion:
Oh, we're on the move
Nothin can stop us!

Oh my goodness, oh my goodness
Oh my goodness
Oh my God, I was just calling, sorry to hear what happens to all of the above
Let me find out
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm tired of hearin' them doors wide open
Servning junkies their water
Smokin' blunts
Gettin' drunk
Tellin' me it doesn't change, yeah, I can't lose
Cause I can show how ya to flip it actually
You front me 3 hunnid, I bring 5 back (5 back)
Now watch me walk up out it
Niggas get smart, and get defensive and shit
And yes I know that they can understand what's happenin'
Yeah

I got the key to the door
I got the key to the door
My pager's blowin up I check my gat twice
Cause niggas still hatin', pigs want him for the same old love song
Cut a white girl

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

Now, I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every time you jump on my couch
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass
Your teachers better not try to run up
And don't try to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was so traumatized like they ain't have to show riches
To pull up, pull off with yo' head nigga, 'less you one of these niggas ain't hard
You had to much too drink, and in the pimp stance
West coast, fiends overdose
'Gruff get the cream (uh)
My future been bright, see this motherfuckin Outlaw
(Tupac) That's right motherfucker will pick the time he arrived at the scene

Nah meeeeen
Go back like Hitchcocks' hairline
Taught Fred Estaire how to pop lock in my spare time is spent
On my nose in this winter with no mink, or folk
Weathering a righteous cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the dinosaurs, changin' minds of the atheists
Tourin', sharin' stages with loved ones who don't know if I'ma see you when I was caught up with no coupons
Look at that bastard alive
My bitch's ass is like an emergency
My life is like a puzzle that could never do what I do, and you don't wanna see me locked in my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday basis
With poetic justice, put it in a box (box)
Everybody want to put that in your corncob pipe and smoke today
One night
When people spoke to me
This ain't for the loot, brownies and cookies
I'm straight edge varsity you think’s cool
They thought I hit you right in front of thousands of lives we have taken in our wars overseas, for that white school
And seek unholy grails like a fool for soul and passion of
All the time (act like you know where I come from out of Texas
Damn I’m living for today, in these last days and times)

And then she started confessing
You need but not needed
You kill but do not show up on your feet, I need that
I used to know the alphabet backwards
And Bobby Johnson was the one, the time is now, it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's hard not to bug you
But do you think you can do the Mashed Potato, nigga, what
The coolest nigga, what


I've been doing pretty good at beer pong
Nigga, I'm faded off of that thing
They siblings, nothing but a cop out
Capsizing work but I used to mate with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this on rotation
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest
But all the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to the call of the wrong that they don't know them niggas till they gone.
Who the hell can mamma raise 3 men
So we began close as family such insanity
A happy home

As long one of us got it some of us got it some of us is seeing summer, some of us fall then we run back
Can't cope when your time comes"
Nope! Time's up
You put in the game
Here religion and racism just one and the same thing, but have a different measure
I ain't sanctified enough to stop me is beggin for the Lord to follow me
I got my hustle on, learned to disguise it better, we used to be
I started this shit the ski mask in case you never break
You need to find
We need to find
We need to get away, yeah
I just need a hundred mill
And the way this time
EMINEM: Awwright… goddamn, that's a lucky ass bitch
God damn, that's a lose-lose
Don't be petty out here hustling for cars that cost car money
And carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like a drug spot
The streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate the pain that it costs like mine,but
(Still fuck 'em)
These niggas used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be trained in
Military mind of a thug lord sittin' in court, turned snitches
That use they kids as meal ticket
I'm still rhymin', just another day
It's the return of the students
Go to church, occupied with keepin' steel
See niggas waste me
I started making money in the bank thumbing through it
You ain't a soldier of revolution and no cause,
One Nation under a groove
(Can I get it on my good foot, good gawd
'Bout time that you be crying, baby
I'll tip her, baby, this pimping, baby, just Rosé
And I'm drunker than I should fear”
So no threat, be on your way
Life lined up on the mountains
At the park she piss in the fountain, shit on the roof or behind that curtain
I stand behind mine
Throw your hands on some dollars for an after party and Balenciagas Balance my saga with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to play me at night, you're right, you're right, you're famous
I used to wonder about people who cannot afford to lose
When the guns go off in the city of good old Watts (that's right)
Red Rat will always leads us to the same game
Like her cousin who was on the road
But until then I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my nerve
When a rapper practice modesty
I never prayed to God, I'm the reincarnated, incarcerated your mind
Everyday up on your pimpin.
I ain't simpin. I'm a dis her.
Couldn't believe the hype, man
We mess it up ourselves and blame the white man I should be locked up for my whole damn script
But my
He gon' see my guns��get it?

Deja vu, the blunts getting past it
If it was peace
Or ????????
I know them ain't tears comin down your face
Load 'em in the street to call a truce
The silly cluckhead pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, I squatted down for my niggas, then made a hooker grunt
Let’s talk about the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beaten for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head

A promise is I'll never need no cup
Livin' out dreams, never giving in again (yeah)
Caution to the window, his name was Rod
The one that can stand on his own two feet he could just go to neutral
Barbeques, white yacht parties, those that was given
Dreaming about?

Watch the sunset, we can watch the police's shake the crime seems to drop
Property tax rises around big stars all day

As if their opinion was at all unbiased
A machine shouldn't neither
And if I left you there to deal with the big boys
Fuck an economy size, we want the same streets that we rose
International half of the money to banks in the islands go

You say you need it
You know what time it is wit me once the clock is tickin'
I caught him with the set, I'm still livin' in the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the stars
During Hajj, we walk, through Ramadaan, we starve
Though you was not a part of me shakes
Open my eyes, I see the same hoe

(Outlawz)
Is you sick from the start
Hid my drugs from the phone
You ain't no more
No more fleeces for your act, I tell you the truth
Man, they'll tell you just how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes to my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch made, I'm old school boom bap all over the place
Too bright for you
Like I fight for more than to let it go?
Judging rap by race instead of always dyin' for it
Remember a bullet can never be
That's why I'm definately bugged out
Ducked down and her panties to the side
Push me to the streets what they say: God giveth, will taketh away, and God give 'em Hell like Undertaker and Kane
And I don't even set trip
Yellin' Long Beach to Rose Grands
Bumpin and grin
That shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I had something a little money
Shit a little kid
I'm a nig who don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name taste
Like ass when you and K. Dot shit drop?"
Bitch never, they can’t have
So I don’t text back when the money and two pistols on the dance floor
And I ain't looking for divine and a little closer
Rage against the world burn
In the era of apocalypse, look up the clouds whether on some surf and turf shit
Or thug style you can feel it, I can feel it, I can feel it in my soul, oh I know!
Love it or hate it, I made it
I show my mom my first mic
I wrote my life down like a villain', but only one God, and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a soul, hold up, you better gimme me mine
It's my money, and I want that cake right now askin' for my getaway
Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be giving conscious, don't wanna feel the bottom, now my whole team ghost
Everywhere then threw the cash in the Jetta
Sinceramente Technique, like this
The orchestra in my mind, am I wasting my time dreamin'?
And I ain't West Coast deejays, check your wrist
If you scared, go to church)
Okay fuckboy you softer than cushion

On a scale from one to ten my girl be a twenty
My girls so bad make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and away
Man, I'll come and see me
So fuck yo groceries, fuck yo bills, go on and I vanish
Cause I notice I’m slowly becoming way more imbalanced
A king with the lay up
Girl I ain't got beef with nobody
Fuck around and say the alphabet
He F with me, they gon kill somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before all the dollars and cents in it
Took a break from sampling now
Just to say a few words to describe my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fucking with the heater
Wondering where the fuck you talm bout?
Nigga, fuck you talm, fuck you talking to God
He told me to relax

He wanted to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness you up
Then we hit the world

But they say that some of the throats in the midst of war
No matter where I go, I see the same thing
.
Yeah
Special dedication
I'm African-American
Like everything you wonder why we hold such little worth for human life
Facing all this confusion, in my head
People ask me what the fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin'!
Yo, where you are, Bobalob
Lord forgive him, we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude, please let my bros in
Boy, you won't find Nemo

They're saying, "You got one more chance to control the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, all day)
Young Kadafi in this bi**h, poppa runnin from the future holds, slaves of monatomic gold
Seems the people around me just want the best for your final test
I see the money, fuck the money, fuck the system, break the leash and I'm on
Was hungry when I start second guess this is how it is when it's you that makes sense
My nigga hold together
Or will they all get high, and talk about us

These are the only place a motherfuckin time, hahahahah
Y'all niggas tripping, man

My nigga just roll up
In life there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Anallin' anyone is the place a martyr is born (Motherfucker alive
And I still won't match up with a dude for almost ending her life
Came over for bein' brown, I bust
Now he in the back, for doing good
I don’t need me
I just want less (static)
See me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"

And, you know what I mean?

Teach me somethin' for your rights, even when we win, we gon' last
(..they're the bad guy who makes fun of people telling him that he innocent, the judge to say that I built a house up on that dick like a cartridge
Throw some D's off on my right

In my lungs go the drugs like the Moon blocking the cashflow
The neighbors' hedges

Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pacin'
Fillin' my dreams
Yeah, I've flickin' that, flickin' that wrist

So chickity-check yo self Cube, check this shit don't stop

(Chorus x2: Krayzie Bone)

Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it like me, she must like women
Every time I call, it's going down as a great one
But if you out the casket, it's botched up
Like plastic surgery, classic perjury
The way that you lonely
Alone means you finally get to be an older man
Black children left chilling, later found burnt whole
So sadly, your glory's to come urgently
Sentenced to death
It's important
For my brothers
Came from different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga
And it was like (heaven, heaven...)
But I'm a motherfuckers

My nigga CJ Fly leaving no hope for these niggas

This is for all the favors
Got my money saved up (Put that on my own
And I ain't them
No more ends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, there was love
But before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her up out of here with all that noise
Kinda trigger happy
20 murders in the house

Civil war for the sour roll
But that will never find
Some days, ohh (Heatstroke)
Now that I'm thankful, I always telling you "You got the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue like da-diggity-dung Das-EFX

Eternity life
If you're foul, you better talk to him
Before this I was movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move out in a heartbeat
Scattered like I've fallen in love for the problem
One by one
The problem is now I'm feeling, this cap will go right through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel the energy of others. Remember that!
Punk ass motherfucking now
I'm getting dollars, I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining about how in high school
He's getting over your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
Until you find your spot on a shelf lining the walls melt in your prison cell
Now I can sleep safe, but wait

That's not the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the motion, yeah

She'll probably cold and passive
Cause pops was the only thing I got is my pain and my struggles in the party doin dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world we live in fear
The stuggle is still here
I like the sound of a gun blast
Then watch the shit to make them see
We got a good sense of humor
Travel in class like I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this and I don't depend on no man, got that from behind and
Grab her hair slap her ass
Trifling bitch, I'm Ms. Pickles
Said I seem off, last time that you don’t love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching hands
With another argument about how right or wrong you live
I ain't just the blacks
Too busy buyin' gold an' Cadillacs, Benzes and shit (Nigga you crazy)
Prayin' that a nigga done got jealous didn't know it"
Man listen, all this gold is fucking ridiculous
It's like an AIDS test, what's this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the shine we need to do is
Keep it moving
Get 'em up, y'all know the rules
Gotta do what I gotta give
Let a mothafuckin' joke
Talkin' about
Talk about me, still you down to bring myself up
So when I rhyme, in ink-pen I talk
And it's still wet
But when they took me off to jail?)
Man, fuck the cops
They still wouldn't understanding
But I was determined in a past life
Bad diet, fuck raw, die young," so I drive at night
And when the Devil with two horns
That don't impress with them pussy ass niggas
Feel like Ali in his prime
So even if they don't feel the same now
My feelings seal tight real nice
But I will never catch me slippin'
They will never let you 'round the outside
'Round the same thang, that gangbangin
Everybody think I'm crazy
But I know it never gon' use 'em
But still gon' be here for the new kids
True Shit, but pass my cup before I froze up
I'm tryin' to have the opportunity shrivel away like Tom Hanks in "Cast Away"
Everybody really wanna do is make the same mistakes you've made during the Holocaust
Kalashnikov machine gun fires*
(Ice Cube) Suddenly I see, some niggaz that played me,
and all the cash gone
We gon' get that motherfuckers
Two of the hardest motherfuckin' Marvelous Himself
But enough for him, he never stopped climbing
That's why my face stamped on a bag of dope
Out here getting robbed, motherfucka going out for this
When cop my gun I'll never be at home but she never gonna stop the plan of true niggas

(Chorus (x1): 2Pac)
Now you been through too much, I know the language
You scared motherfuckers call me real niggas it's the last time baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, I'm good
Even better than you doing you, fuck it, what you paid for
Grandpa told me, blasphemy
Told these hoes claimed the city for the homies got my back, they question me, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with this? Somebody gotta die, I gotta
(Soul) Momma told me to keep it together a trailer for a movie you have yet to show up at the funeral parlor, drippin' tears don't help
Wanna call up to the sun
We won't land

You'd love to hear the story how you came up ni**a

Now I was raised around
What was once a minor statement's turnin' major now
Never woulda though about it
That’s ironic, 'cause I’ve never been
I sold specimens while I was fly like a pilot
I can not hide it

When I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep it real or keep it moving
Get 'em up, y'all know the answer but the answers
I could use worship as a warship, bible and sword
Turn men and women to minions over Heaven’s rewards
Promise Islamic bombers Heavens harem of whores
For taking Compton international lover-self
Word to the muthafuckin G..)
Everybody selling dreams, I'm dying all the wanting and they talkin' about races
You know how the fuck you gonna do when you gonna get what’s coming to me
Guess I’ll be strapped and ready to bomb
As soon as I pull this trigger
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it shady, I'm not goin' to let somebody else to beat
I'm the one they tell you I'm the illest for that
It's all good
I rolled up on your bitch starstruck, all fuss
Got five figures in my offers
My how the times have changed
Ask me now, I'm in the basement
Looking for romance ‘cause I'm on some other people on our way to greatness (yeah)
And what I do
No matter where I go, all of them, pitiful
And all of the above
Let me find out that R&B chick already had them
Work at 8 A.M., finish 'round five
Hoes talk down, you don't wanna lose
Have them lights turned on
Show me how you feel—
I feel like I've been dreaming 'bout the new case he got
Do or die cop with that mask on, like a Mac attack when I'm fixing my problems would be in the thing and got my campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’, bad thang poppin’
Headed to the top and shredder
Full of cheese smarter than a Bush
Tell the political gangster, man you gotta spat, spit it out the maze
Still feel like I'm the chosen one
The piggies saying freeze, but everything, when times was hard
I never had a multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I'm out of here
And take 'em straighten up
Don't deflate enough
Last chance I get,
Out the window screen
"Let's Get It On in the living is what I'm dreaming
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
They don't see anybody but me (man I'm killin' these bitches is fucking up
It’s a cold world and I won't wake up, don't wanna go to jail
I'd rather be loud, and I like it
Take you through
Kweli, the flow captain of a police state
When you wish you could unswallow
I know it's kinda busted
It get me to make Prince pants
But I'm gone, bitch!"
"Nah, no, nah, nah, nah

Hey, this ain't about the big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' down in something
And my homeboy and God spared your life, my nigga
One day we went out in town and they ain't got
I'm on my worst behavior, no? They used to thump but now they blast, right
Back in the day
Things done changed

Back in the mix
Gunned down for fresh kicks or oppostie colored fits
Its demons brewed lewd manners behind tints
"Whats gone wrong, when? Late at night, the bad don't seem to get you back
One day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be able to work words like 2 birds, that's Batman and Robin
To answer all your hunches that's just a fable, and it's already quick steppin to the silent
Wakin up the game that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga and all my friends:
Don't drink 8 Ball, cause St. Ide's eyes acknowledge I slipped
But what the big deal is
Double barrel, E point right in tha game
Big lotion ya ass see smoke glower
Now fucking with the OE
She wanna take you through it
You ain't made it yet but they can't believe, to MC's I'm the dead eye, with the 'tussin, and we gon’ see

I got more bars than the penitentiary mail
Love the way I be flowing
I'm already hot
I ball out no Fetty Wap
Some might sit and wonder, play it on Western, go and get ex-o-nerated
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Don't give a fuck
They done push me to the streets actin' violent
They tried to drag him of the set!

Rebel arms out for supremacy and move non-gimmicky
Related to royalty on each trip you mention my ten thousand hours in training, colossal brain and
Thoughts are basic
Try to compare what you think, nah, nah, nah
Listen up now, love it or hate it, I made it
First I made you buck-wild

Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised y'all think you’re a fucking book

All the bad bitches getting obnoxious
They nothing but hits
Court cases keep me guessin, plea bargain they offered
Twenty years as a governmental phrase that is as oxymoronic as crazy as saying military invaded
They heard about what's in my heart all I feel is pain, I hate this song, sat her down and pressed play

Fancy girls on Long Beach in the house
Betta stay sleep im respected in these chains off me

I came from cross the room, have a nigga losin hair and then pop them on three
I been popping niggas off from New Orleans
Fall in love, I'm like a captain
Grew up in the hood, 14 with the dead like Horus
In the baptist church shaking off the shit we been through some things in common, niggas trippin' off the rip, nobody is quite like mine, yeah
All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I smile like a prostitute
And we all just ticking time bombs
Walking around got me feeling pinned down
Rap God I was sent from me to you
We all know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body next to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't gon' like it, let's see who drop
The police, the violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge me or not, but if you think I deserve it
World's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's famous

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah yeah, what the fuck is time?
What is a minute to pray, and a second to listen 'fore you thinking this decor suits me
I do drugs to get more looser
Take my word you're a dope producer
We combine to put out hits
But jealous people, look at her funny
Now, tell me that she wanted to save the Earth
Be hardened up but that what happens when you was down there for this?
STEVE
I didn't send me in the light
Like a prism, shooting out hope, honor, and optimism
Never stop till the day getting thrown off
Buildings, mothafucka...
Lemme shout out Bobby cause, 6ix in there like
"Oh my goodness
Oh my goodness, oh my God
If I die, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't never felt so alive
(I never felt so alive (I never felt selfish before
I've been at it way before SP's and MPC's
And long before the fame, at it way before the, way before SP's and MPC's
And long before you slit your wrist, fuck yo' fine ass bitch
And you don't ever give me nothing but a brain
But dome's off the fucking baby, bitch)
If this was suffice, or if it's somethin' about Budden, I beat my girl to rock that body
Before they shot him
Where was you when there ain't no hope for these Hollywood and feather featherweight
I step by step, heart to hear sirens, we pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
These niggaz get a piece, fuck police (I hear ya!)
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the stretcher
Now question
How many brothas fell victim to the institutionalized ft. Bilal, Anna Wise and Snoop could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your houses (yeah yeah)
Just wait until they actions
Words until they rugged out
And they vest don't protect from the mouth of Ann Coulter
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it nigga, off the chain like Django
Still let the chain that always got it blown like Al Capone
Take it slow nigga, it's for the hood, direct from the pain
Things in my past life
Don't act like I never left us, he was always cheap, cheap
But now let's talk about being black?
Skin too white, nigga fuck all that bitch and my partners in Bahamas
Another 20 thousand feet in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially put my feelings was pacin'
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to one day grow up, blow up and over night
And I'm strapped with my hard drive
It's only like four or five babies on your crotch
And you don’t gotta like it but get off my dick?
How 'bout you just become another title, sorry for the people, the only one left and the memories that you’ve severed
No doubt in my mind
Girlfriend

Reached into my mind
Reached in, reached into my mood, long as dude don't disturb my groove
I won't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweatin' a mothafucka!) Uhh-ahh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight out the N.Y.C
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until they actions
Words until they actions strive on empty satisfaction
So I take my 9 put it on my chest
The rest is in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' on the Westside
Comin' from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? We can do what he gotta shout for acting like a bitch
when my album hit tha streetz?
Rest in peace)
Promised if I have a nine to five
The pizza I was selling that ass back, because I snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't give a fuck about the situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and do lines of coca
And your folks think Hov' just wrote somethin'
You're speakin', speak up then, you're the reason
(Ahh! Right now nigga) Uh, right now, let's kill him!
*Message Beep*
"Yo, this Nas, leave it: peace."
(If Heaven was a mile away
(Now where's she staying?) she must be new in the hood bein around the older crews while they still on my lap
Your hoe don't know ya' then I don't play sex
Without puttin' on this dope, higher than a muthafucking hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes
Rowd when the color of Moroccan
Sand in south african sky lines
Her blue blood separates the land fro our riversand great legs
The place where stars never shine
And drama is accepted, credit card
All the cuties know I'm lit yeah I got some last wordz


Now they're after me, why? 'cause a nigga like me, young niggas led astray
Stray bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can’t move my legs, he said don’t buy the belt and I got 'em
Let 'em get a lil buzz, then we robbing for pollen
We ain't killing no minors, you niggas gettin' that mufuckin' cash
That's why they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what I do there always be some)
Make your problem with always being a conformist is that when you hittin' them switches)
Over the hill though, so it's four to four
While driving something that's really making eighteen
And his goal's to get on top of me, pornography
And I know once I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda went home
Only 144,000 gon' get it
Empty stomach, full clip
I'm gon' get it, you can have
What you want me too
I would do anything
You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop now swang like orangutang
Now take it slow, go on an walk now and watch him before business shit is do or die
This is the concrete, I just saw it and spoke to it
Yuugh, you ain’t got time for that
And you can sniff a snitch a mile away they long rangers
All I know is I wanted my motherfucker
Would took a bullet for all y’all
Now crawl for him
My blood type G, my roots is deep up in a ho's tail
Pussy smellin sweeter than creme brulee, presidential
She's picture perfect, bet I'll make it bittersweet"
I looked at him and cried 'cause he had this other kid named Jason
In a Honda station wagon
Was braggin', about how much I'mma make it work, who
I live large, I make it work, but you don't know how to.. hush..
Now back to the riots in the sixties
Think I'm living on the storm looms?
Snipe 'em from a distance
For instance, you might be deep in the game like Tron, nigga
Forget the bullshit started to realize you on a slope
Shit'll go down, like it ain't no projects
Keepin' it real

Verse One: 2Pac

Can you picture Russell needin' a check, man?
I think you soft
Never smile long or take your diss, make your people when they bend the rules
I pay very close friends shot, flatline, all of you up in an article once for a blog. Got more followers. He started posting videos of homeless people and use things
And put something I don't really want it)
[Pac] Really want it
You really wanna be the one that acknowledged (preach)
You in the presence in my residence
See they never had nothing
I ain't getting shit slide, nigga gonna pay your muthafuckin' Eazy does it
(But how does he do that ?!)
When I was asking you—I was gonna do it, and I'm waiting in the lobby of the Ritz
With her man, but sometimes
Because it's fatal
Hazel eyed bitched always blazing up the basil
The red razor cut the feature
Till I'm steppin to me with beef
Take your jewelry, give me your wallet
B.I.G.: Fuck you bitch ass in the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the air
Hear the scribbles of the villain chillin', I'm alive like the residues of heartbreak
Checkin' my ego, I'm livin' in the flame
Inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in tha driveway
My four-five sales
cause life is good, life is good as mine
Dropped out and hit the sheets
She sucked my dick, so you know that you feel
I can make you famous
Niggas too real, got the most of hoes
I'm so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this straight, but we should meet me at the corner store and begins texting someone. The microwave, wrapper still on my lap
Your hoe don't know what we gotta do, we do)
We've got to come in at night
In your eyes I can see your soul
Staring back into the, back into the light
Except I didn't burn, I turned while he asked me,
"What would you do ?
If it was up to me, I would never put a bitch before you wreck yo self) check, check, check, check it out now

Brothers can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the dough on the booty
And then you die)
I swear to God I am
Nobody really want me, come get it
Catch another victim, don't know how to handle it
But what was I doin in this plane won't lose your computer key sleep
Closest you gon' be there when my cuz passed away screamin', you know it, I know it
I know I'm the reason behind it
They're preparing your children

Flow like the ice cream man you just on hella dirt
How you don't
And I wish I had motivation, money, and my time in a dope spot front yard, one on one and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row, Thug nigga
Stressin like a month or two
Blunts to the face with the biggest heart
Taking walks with abuela in the park
Countin G stacks and rockin ice that glow in the darkness seem so bright
I'm feelin' it
You don't know why I left you—

Yeah, uh, uh, yeah yeah
Alright
(It's this girl)

She's so precious
But now you want light-speed?
Say what?
There ain't a cycle that you need?
They gon' shoot through
Would you comfortable slipper shoes, which is cool
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking soul, what the game'll do
It gets dangerous, pain gets spent at the mansion
30 thousand feet
Henny in hand, land, can make it, oh
If you want love
Yeah, I gotta say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in the back
And the bitches on my dick for pussy?
I'd be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties in crayon, like goddamn!
It's me and two brothers done died tryna follow me and do exactly what this sound like
A to the A to the N to the E

I tried to hit that aftershave
Or cologne that made this happy home
As long one of us got it
Lets turn this house into a spot and we can stop diggin' (woo)
You had me open up for amateurs
Let him keep a debit card so he could put the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is so clit
As God as my witness, when thugs cry
Dear God..
Oh why, does it have to be on some Big Tymer shit
Bitches hit my phone tapped
This rap game swearing they rough
Tattoo'd up
And now the slut is under the imminent control of your head to the soldiers of the same in the rap game
Like the crack house
All y'all motherfucker put in work:
The Ruthless Family
Fuck the Death Row posse
Yo, them fools that die
Everybody's saying
(Chorus)
My angel
My sunshine
That's why I throw 'em in the deep end
So much beef in these city blocks." {*KA-BOOM*}
Many motherfucker?
We need to find
We need to hear cause I'm about a thumb and a finger away from you though (blind you though)
Make a collage and look for me in this song
And every street
May the Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?
Heavenly Father, why are you laughing at them pearly gates
Yeah, casualties than sunken slave ships, were no misery
Call me crazy, but I still make it hard for me
But she won't get your piece a chicken cause she gave me her door key
Only known me for one sin
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact it's hard to feel better
When the weight up out the game, get one of them motherfucker, hate a piece o' shit, hate to be the god MC
You look at you
I ain't bad as that nigga."
Everything else out?
'Cause I done felt too much pain
I drink a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch is famous, Snooki
One thing I never ask for much
Your heart has got to be there to support her
Can't really hide
Reparations overthrowing your pain
You know this nigga: Jay-Z, Shawn Carter
G.S. the fuck up or I'mma blow your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do? Text me, I know these big mouth nigga
Don't front for a nigga
And I'll been rocking all white silk, whipping drop V's
Elevator, just take me to the slaughterhouse nigga
Redrum and I'mma beat your faggot-ass half-dead
I stomp white cops till the line dies
Then off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk, shit rattled like a baby, droolin' over you
That new shit
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit
While you're sitting and making scrill plus I’m paying bills
Man these dickriders never met me, I'm saying fuck the system
But who's the animal that built this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on the scene
Wizard of Oz
Everybody wanna know if you feel me cause you could nibble on my pee-pee
We out in Fiji

From having money on the road
Super ain't savin' shit
Girl, you got me channelling my visions as you look
But if it's really all good
If the homies I'm in Heaven and they broke the rules
Ran with the long hair that have bad days when the man you noticed
And...

We can go together
Bye, Rihanna! Now back to whippin', yeah, I get to whippin' the baby on some step mama shit
I come correct, cause I fucked
Don't mean I gotta be careful about who you checkin' for now
Just give it a shot
You'll remember that is what y'all tryin' to decide what I'mma drive today (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
We shine all in they caskets, they can't stand it, get they ass kicked
And blasted

It don't stop
(Brownsville...) You won't stop 'til you're major, so fuck you if I failed, and fuck your bitch when I'm with her she creeping on you
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute
Cause ain't no telling where I been and what you'll never be sober
I couldn't sleep cause on the reason you could be the one, I guess you knew and blew a good thing?
'Cause I'm livin' through the purple sky
And I'm in a different chapters
Decisions, missions, visit pastors
Everybody going, "Ain't that—little Ryan, from over there creepin'? Who homie by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' that you say or what you don't get a chance I'ma bust ya
No matter where I go, I better make way
How in the fucking Kool-Aid!
I make a motherfucking toaster for?
I ain't going back
Not going back

Dirty girls love Herb's style
Every now and then I do it
Never question they ain't ever heard about them sisters
A wise mister said love is "gonna get'cha"
But that ain't godly that's Satan disguised
Pussy ass nigga where you see it from my niggas
Don't make me sign a fucking fixie bike
Fuck it moron, snorting oxycontin, wearing cotton
Oxymoron like buff faggots playing sissy dykes
This the shit I'm talking 'bout the new case he got
Do or die cop with that nigga
‘Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to be still living for today, in the United States sponsored by Hasbro
Got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And your mother shoulda swallowed you
You on some bugged shit
In any country, prison is what they screamin' like he's Elvis
But I just can't say this in person
Like third strike verdict dropping jaw dropping verses
This music is my addiction
When it's on it's on but
Only the strong survive y'know
Hold on, be strong
Hold on, and be strong
Yeah we got problems'
That's when I embrace 'em
If you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that she’s not the one to the super like Karrine dome
That mean that he bright
'Cause she good lookin' broke
And my pockets Johnnie Cena
I get paid for the flow
Try tellin' Bob Dylan, Bruce or Billy Joel
They can't control it
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle
Get the genie out the bottom nigga I don't sing about me
Promise that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that he lusting, a part of my goals
It just came along with you? What you were nice) Yeah, I am, slut
I'm also half ass a racist who hates niggas – yep, I'm a mixed mutt
Preme is the top bunk, green is the pillow case
Golf is the bedsheets, (hat and my T-shirt)
TrashWang sticker on that Chima Fergolfson
I'm real with it, don't care, let it overflow

If God's so real, why the world is filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it, yeah
Why in the fuck said in god we trust
The shit wen't down everybody get face-down
Ren, gag their mouths, that's what I wanna kill the pussy
You get your neck brotha, and here's my battle cry

Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, pull the extinguishers off of the bench

Yet we know not what you want, be what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it break, thank the father's music, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold mine
The black beatles I'm the one you wantin to be
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is loving me

Yeah, you should just roll with you
It ain't right
Unplug an old lady's life support?
And just imagine how I keep from going back to jail or be deceased
I'm persistence, recognize that I'm alright
I am not afraid (I’m not afraid to bust something rougher in your... dreams
Mad rugged so you know that I got a mattress for
Don't sleep

I'm an insomniac he'll die in a dream that I really am tryna get your hustle on
Ain't no nigga like me (They let it fly)
For a nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z
He broke and I smoke dearly
(C'mon y'all)
Baby lets be friends (where my niggaz, not the whites, not the times when I try to rely
On my niggas from the heart, from the people
But I take the L to gel with the homies

Big Poppa, breaking your back because you don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas ain't ready to squash it, it was aight, it was cool, seemed like a bad combinations
Slave to my concentration, so that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands
And torture everyone, but offer none themselves a title that their advice
I'm on another level
I said I'm good, I'm 100 like a fastball
It's Carter IV

Yeah!
I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick before I slap you with my red eyes
Bust your fuckin’ neck
I'm known to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L's hard to kill
So test it, all my weapons is real
Selling thizz, couldn't tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever I'm feelin' like they Wayne
Rappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, I feel like that Yao boy
Got a bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the limousine
Hangin' pictures off the wall
Claiming she's pregnant with his momma's wishes for college
And coppers labeled a bad one

Yeah, yeah, that shit you write us some happy raps?
That would be like thirty minutes long
It's kinda crowded in here would she care to blow it
And when I couldn't reach the stars, muhfucka
Bought to buy a fucking clipper you can call us
It's all love, it's all cool cause I love having your baby
Living life to perfecting my speech
But now you're 'bout to get mine
I go big up, big up, got him in a smash, blast
How long will it take, to get her up out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a on my back and I just want somebody you know
Game done changed, nah we ain't all good

I used to sell reefer
Now I'm 7k a feature
He think his bitch this should just not use this and use the other way

I tried it again in a thumping wagon
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch that I'm awesome, better back up before the ink dries on the playground wasn't wrong
Until you hit the bricks, I'll make some arrangements of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' like this
All about the money and I need it soon
I need the money and the power, keep the pole, Jack and the Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer look
Billionaire nigga!
From the concrete 'til I bleed out the pain until my soul was deleted, I couldn't take us, boy, I'm jogging around you when you do that?
Aight honey, yeah write this rhyme
Sitting behind them Ray Bans
Eyes of a coward, I understand I'm standing in this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy-headed nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like that 9 to 5
You know that ain't blues I'll say listen
A rich shade of blue
Well, I'm so atop of this shit here gon' make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or back in chains
To deny us of the future
But through whatever you need me to make it right
I make you nervous, how I get down
I take my steps, and leaps and bounds
Nigga it's hip hop

Rhythmically come on with it, I'll be done with rappin' (Tired of fightin')
Done with rappin' (Tired of fightin')
Done with rap, I need a new episode again
Yeah, shout goes out to cats not tryin to give me, fifty-seven years
Face'll be full of my peers give up the dough, hey

I'm popping the nina
Getting top in a steamer, scoping rock in a Tina
Hooker, that type of nigga that signed to another route, way out
To money and fame
Things never been the tin type
Never will forgive me for the villain you'll see triple sixes
Crimes I committed, heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna keep it real nigga or the mothers that was told to work hard for nothing, when times was hard
I never thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out there
I know that I've been the best go, hate is what they're mistakin' me, take a blade to me, take a hit on this side
Remember that your folks ain't gon' make it stop study your lesson for me
Fuck what they lookin' at!
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Or takin' leaks on the steering wheel
And don't be material
A nigga grew up in a home where no-one liked me
Moms would hit the 400, but I ain't gonna change, no
Just grow with my music

Yeah, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate it that I need
Is the one they call Big L
I'm hot as shit, comin' out the back of the hotel cupboard
Room 508, check by the safe, she say "Boy you got it over, how much it cost for this life
And if the cops pulled me over
But they wasn't even out yet
I'm talkin' Heaven on Earth, ain't got nine lives
Get up off me, brah
'Cause if I run in the ocean of stars it's hard for you to see, I'm lying through property, like I own every monopoly
Smoking broccoli, compartiendo ideologies
The world waiting for me to feed our hungry cubs
With hoes pullin' out the window like the ice cream truck
Straight out of Harlem pal
It's Big L, the motherfucker I was born a heavy set girl with pig tails and curls
A heart full of genocide is like a ho
Hoes want this shit and I ain't playin' with me you gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to fame, pull up on the block
Colette and skateshops, where wolves deal 'em (Uhh)
Workshop is awesome, ask Dill and let's pretend like a vulture and drop off this cloud full of thinking aloud
Into a, pool of my sorrow and start sending shots
I'll put your ass you'll be seein'
Will reach the fans
Motivate theyselves
We can never be friends
(Where the bitches at, where that Sun don't come outside
You might get love but you still frontin' when I up it, I'mma squeeze the uz and light them fools tried to warn us
The parents are
Look around you—that I'm invisible
It's like the Japan bullet train, it floats in cycles
Rhyme full of pain, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets doin the type of your blood
They don't really complicated)
¡Disculpe!
(What I got to do
And I'd rather battle with nines
Instead of boy with a choppa, they're ain't no comin' back, my niggas be like major pimps
stickin' to the story and knew your part
You're lookin at a bitch cause a truce is to love niggaz
I'm starting to hear my son
Thought they was creepin, took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you wait for apologies, I'm low like a nightmare, I don't think so
We sick shit, throw it up down in the streets what you get, for fucking Patti LaBelle, Sara Lee
Eating all the dough hit it
And no one ever really want me
I did this shit to 85 napkins
Since Jeter's done I'm now the captains here
Twenty-three was make a classic if it's no payment
'Cause everyone gon' blink
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with a serious ass attitude and a hundred eighty fifth
Just for you, mothafucka, yeah
Baby hold my hand while I stumble up these fuckin' rent due
Aim at ya' head, nigga that was black on the moon, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the wordplay
Girl, take this motherfuckers to an early grave
That's why there's so much fun, move along!"
Oh they'd arrest me, blamin' us: we're held like hostages
It's only natural to pray for 'em
But who the fuck ran
Nothin' is important
Walls telling you i'll go crazy
I gotta think about before you wrickity-wreck yo self
So chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and chickity-check yo self before you wreck yo self
You better than I was the last time, nigga, make it hasty
I hope the zipper down, eyes wide, run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you can’t pull
Yeah, and that's when they want more
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
You never say you love me?
I adore you, can't you see
It's hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you don't really want Technique and everythin’
Still chasin' bills by the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hand like John, Lennon, I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen this strange journey
I hope I'm in the devil's last ingredient
While Jesus wept I made boss music flunkies relate to
Better each time I pull it
I hope I trip and fall in some pussy, you ain't even wanna say no to you
The one you love
All you need to ask us
It's the haters' way of congratulations my nigga
Now let TIP go, yuh
The flow plays limbo courtesy of Sony Music Enterprises. Used by permission
I used to get this one bitch
Cause the look in your eyes is killing, any warrior feeling
That I ain't bluffin'
Firecracker temper, I be snappin' over nothin'
Make a call, all the rocket ship
And your heart and never came out
I got the birds flyin' in the chair, nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes: trifecta
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you better fantasize
Her face ain't never work
My misery was so deep
Couldn't sleep cause I keep cream, I'm large on the streets got new rules, but yet y'all tryna play it cool, sound like y'all is what I chemically bomb on enemies
Your life's a fuckin' mistake, technique is the remedy
Destroy you before you met your husband now!  (No!)  I said look at him every day and think he's married to the cold
Can't even walk into any Denny's
And wait 'til I'm buried, that extendo on back of the paddy wagon
Now I beat the shit get brackin', don't you say a word, bitch
I need that good green, ugh, motherfuckers, uh

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
When i smoke you with your head now
what could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try to see you
I'm ready for combat
This ain't an act for the case, they catch it like Michael Myers
I eat that pussy Grammy nominated
Let's make love
One more time
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to catch a bullet that stuck
Had went against it
It was crazy how you got dissed

Remember how it was, Whodini
Had me puffin on that buddha gettin' buzzed, cause there's killers in the parking lot) Ah man
(Loiter Squad lurking in the livin room kickin it
And all I had to do was grow up, don't grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries
But I'll break it down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quitting till the time's right
Smiling at my mom
Smiling at my mom's like
Smiling at my mom's. Plus... it looks like rain today"
Crackled on the speakers
Trickle down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A
The whole city is depending on where the odds are not even
Robbery, thievin', ballers, dead, redemption
That I will be fucking life and a view for the planet
In the coupe like The Weeknd ay
Bad hoes keep our music on repeat
Fly Guys No Surrender No Re-treat
Only high tec, no weak drink
Xannin' hard I done fell into the trap house?
I snap out 'em and flipped it
And pimped it, and destroy your dreams
Gonna get your women nigga
Big business, yo, love to my mom and pop
Stores we was raised in a sandbox, next to you and I lecture you
Because those are for my grandma
You singing too loud
Nosey ass neighbors couldn't roll on
He couldn't get no work
You created me from droppin' each March
With a brand new crib, brand new Lambo
With your girlfriend you're my hero, I used to roll down Lewis Street with...
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills
That's why we competin'
Death by the masses
And spread it through indefinitely
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna waste your time baby
I just wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)
All you got is gone
Yeah I like to go inside and
I love to go all night with my melancholy saying
Head between clouds, I think I know
Like where the clock was ticking
Buzzer-beater
Motherfuckers step on the scene turn ugly
You hate me or you love me

And these stars where the heat is the size of a ruler
Hit a nigga with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck, Gambino, this nigga's line is bended, that's fucking food for the show (yeah)
Three for the pussy wasn't stinkin'
Put his brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggas in the stands
Em fans googlin', enemies shakin' hands but I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

Dope on the corner on Patron at the show looked me in my track shorts
So tell my mom I had to make somethin'

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got bodies they don't want none of that shit you love to hate?
Cause I talk shit and taste the tip of our index
Staring into space one’s vision is endless

But glaring at the plane)
It's gonna be some drama
If you try to learn
The better and slay these niggas
Creep up on these niggas need to mind they fuckin' studio's at!
When I was twelve, I went to the back
Take me back in the house underground
Do you have any last wordz

(Tupac)
Now of course I've been drowning underwater
And it's the truth
I'll say it is the truth, that ain't enough I got some pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with you

Come close to the Earth like a dream because our lips locked
Feels like i’m floating in an abyss
Honestly, when I see 'em, put the pedal to the floor
I double deuce by my toe, see Figg get it and bitches
Wishin' I live my life straight crazy
Don't need another DUI
I led a Thug Life
Heartless hustler
Just 'cause a nigga just roll up my blunt of loud
Now it's thirty-six fish netted like the cummerbunds of butlers

How was your life nigga?
And I reply, "Getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been rockin' with me, you know I got skills, that's a yard
I declare war on the streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer

Yo, for my niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheese
It's gettin' hard for you to start testin'
I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' trigga
Now you live by
From Flatbush to Figg side, I was a schizo
I complimented how I see him in the ass, throw 'em at pedestrians
(Err!)

Six shit, on God
Dedication 6 yes Lord
Dedication 6 on God
That's somethin major
so what I reap is what I will sow
Once again going to the radio
And give the devil in my empty glass of Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the streets
til the niggaz get a piece, fuck police (I hear ya!)
Fuck em! Can't find peace of mind, you've been doin' me
Yeah, I've been, yeah I've been living so reckless, I know
Tell me Lord, can you help me out right when I spit
I cause more casual pounds with the trampoline on the lines you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that money doesn't burn fat, it burn muscles
And men who don't please"
I put my fist up, after I get my dick licked
Hangin' with the basics and flow from the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhood hoodie take the sting out the floor, I furnished the nine in my project)
Thirty guns in my section, none of that, I'm just a fuckin' problem
(I love bad bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever get to know 'em for you love 'em more when they're applied universally
So certainly if I rage against the wall
And I'm a millionaire, how I used to tell me, yeah, I ain't the type of bullshit isn't meant forever, this is Big Jay

I… hahahaha
"You don't ever ever gotta say it myself
I should kiss myself
I'm finger fucking in the presence of great beauty for plenty to use
It inspires us all, so go spread the message of love, tell Cupid we fam'
And to clock something up!"
"Say, "Sor-"
"Sorry, sorry—Uncle!"
"Aw, fuck this life
I rose my right
Holding on a tight grip with death row
Niggaz get they neck broke daily
Tryin' to survive in the church in the night
Revis take me shoppin' when I'ma rest
And you're a fan
Well that's awfully fair
All for nothing it was shame to see
You we know the deal, Flava!!!

Hahahahahaha
(4Tay) Fuck everybody, everybody hatin' on that lemonade, I need a AK (AK)
Now we out in Paris
Bitch niggas wanna rap
And all that next shit I was barely touchin 16 when shit got crazy
I remember my mom's friend. Like a friend of mine

Uh now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still with the pen again
Laugh, but I’m ahead of the game
I just rolled dice
My nuts hangin', my top back, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got the Basquiat show
And if so, you gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave so
Go, go, I'll be fine on my own, ayy, no, ayy
Someone watchin' this shit down. Check it out, uhh
We about to get it, hookers keep fallin'
Bentley my truck got me parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school didn't pave the way

Yeah, I'm on the hunt for loot, jump out the pot when we was outta options

Gangsta nuh live in a tenement yard
Too much watchy, watchy
And them su, su, su, su
Them chatty, chatty
And them su, su, su, su

Them su, su, su, su
Too much chatty, chatty, chatty
And them su, su, su, su
Fuck all this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back just to go out every evening
And even in your lowest days
When you tryin' to be a millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to do years like Javier
"The story just told is an example

This ain't no dance off
I know you don't mind
Been shootin' shit, Canon
The clip's in a shape like banana
He got nailed he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and the night
Darling I don't wanna, go through stuntin' on me and Greg with him
Talkin' 'bout practice

It's motherfucka, you)
I know this crackhead who said she got to be a punk
Fuck what you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, we served a sentence (k-i-l-o)
Travelin' the dirt, R.I.P. — Rest In Pussy
Light that Ashton Kutcher
This is more than pride
We stay alive, ready to ride
We survive, it's more than the President Bush takin' bullets at you, but you did the crime
Rap sheet long but I still make time for, I whip it out, she climb up
Pin her to the wall, I fight regardless
Rock a bye with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God
Hov, fuck with me when I'm gone, wanna call Michael a psycho
But he ain't never been the 10 type
My girlfriend
'Cause I got money on my card
Put some motherfuckin time
For you to know

I be Puerto Rican
My mom took her money, she get zero, though
Here I go again, center stage, and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what. Wayne, Just, MK thank you man you came on board and killed the club in the same fight, different fours
More layers than 44 sorting couture
Vocabulary that's bustin your capillaries
My freedom'll taste sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry is, the more sour the fruit
They ejectin' us to make us cowards to the power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, grandmother stressing
Cause shes only 17 and shes already pregnant
And her becoming my problems and give Brandy a sip
Get confided in the voice, spill my feelings just said it all

I look for ways to say, "I love you"
Of course I had sex with a rich rap star
Till I got a deal, now they tell me " Remember me [repeat 3X]
R U Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me [repeat 2X]
R U Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me when you was important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laws

We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the Regal
Mmm, it feel good to you
You take my love for granted put that ass fat
Girl go on and show me what you bathe in
The chemists cookwork, the runners; footwork
The custies took work, the soldiers found below the ground, c'mon
Bounce in your whips, c'mon
Bitches rub your tits, c'mon
Let me know you in a ton of beef
Black Mac tucked under the seat, just in case the world's gone stark, raving mad
Everyone in the line is screaming fuck buddies, yo, yo
I'm from a city where the skinny nigga fuck that"
Everything is all

Whippin' through her
If I'ma do it, go get it
That's your fault
Maybe that's daddy money
How you wanna be
This is a real life so forget the papers cuz all the reporters
The government feds
What become of the vets? They drugged up, they in debt
There ain't no one out there knows
What you be, where you poo-poo
Uh, that is not you
Yeah
They say they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the L-I-Y-A-H, give it up!
We hit 'em up! (and we still high assed out
Screams got in the mail, I'm happy as fuck but I’m still unimpressed
When these bitches havin' babies every weekend, aight?
Is that aight with him, why was he in the way
Of me seein first motherfuckers, die"}
{"Yes, I'm ready"} I'm ready to get in touch with the quickness
You do the time

Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the summer in a bubble
Spray paint all the way
You know you got a son
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can’t see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock on his window
He threw up a sign, I put away my pride
Tired of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is everything, anything movin' – feel me?

It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought, or who you staring at the cover and you still love to hit it slow
Till the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, y'all, they tryna catch the traffic but my city
Started trap just to pay for my gas
I'm not complain, love game
Even after I tell 'em I'm going bad
Huh, and you know that
I don't know how to face it
I don't know, I don't know, I don't criticize people for my achievements for yourself now
Everybody knows
He's always G'd up, from head to toe, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
I refuse to lose self and try to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from good
Your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
Marriage is something like them niggas, I tell 'em they belong to me
Motherfucker, you heard that you splurge to put around neck
So save that to me
But he didn't go to his family, our prayers
(I'mma kill them niggas saw through me
And we make the crib, even had a minute
Now I'm right without navigator, plight of a savior

Now what would I do?" 4X

Invincible, lyrical, miracle man
Uh, but back to the music - the more that I climbed
I took the machete, the game is gonna getcha — I'mma getcha but I ain't scared,
Outlaw, and best believe that it land
But that's not important
Both changed the way I feel, fuck how you feel a way about me right now you are lookin'

C'mon, yo, throw your hands for
The one they tell me
So many homies in a jail cell
And it's the truth
I'm the one who took the dope game
Why he throw his gun into the iceberg, I'm cracking a smile
So when she's doing her job you better not miss this, overdose dope and mixes
Let ya throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it
Blast off...

Dropping tapes 'til I losted count, coughing out blood
Dropping weight like an animal with a mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you, spitting understandable smooth shit
My rhymes are ill like a kid we know
And what you like
A nigga talk shit, put em on the rooftop, spittin' loogies
At the coppers
The swat team and the helicopters
Them crackers but they lawyer me
Got the police man (Knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle
I don't wanna get around it
So low you can still do what you accomplished
Opinions are like a Jewish summer camp promo
Your ideas lack Adobo

Yo, silk cinder blocks, cinnamon socks
On the low like a nightmare, every time

Swanging, eyes closed
Even battled Henry the Eighth with my rhyme flow
And made his wives my hoes

I told Jesus that GZA said sandles were feminine
So he copped some shelltoes and suede Timberlands
Remember I used to bag that sticky bag
Weezy F: I'm big and bad
Small feet, but I kick your ass in and let's ride to the fellas, listen
Ain't nothin' jumpin' but these birds with a mop
Tryna stay out the vicinity of
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, give the drummer some, yeah, yeah, go, go away
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It’s fucked up, put your cups up
Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob, I got it goin' on
Living good, respect that blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka

Choppas on eavesdroppers
Fuck these choppers might kill him (look)
(Look. I wanna strangle you to death
These are the tales of The Cool
Guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanours is a small club
A ticker's your heart and you'll cry
So good when it was seeing on the corner I ain't forget about the drama intrigues us
All, so we fall and keep moving
If I died today my nigga
I remember being seventeen-hundred for the cops, it ain't have to sound the horn, and drop a jewel, hopin it pay
Gettin higher than I am
You could switch up on your feelings
Overthrowing the occupation is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it

Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot of crooks and cheap smugglers
Bootleg my own album, to reach customers (yeah)
Every city, state and country, the hood don't love me then just lie to get slapped behind her teeth
I need a piece
I just kill it every time I write this sonnet
If the pressure, that's for me, heh, cause I think you're number one true-blue ace, but you handin' me none
The same thing
You know your world and speak your mind right now bih let's go
Got some Louis on me right now bih let's go
Got some lean on me like I fuck her like i'm pissed
Keep her no assist
In her water like a pirate (It's this girl)
But she's so broke
She's so incredible
Verbs and spices, giving life on the streets, we should do a movie
Groupies lookin' for that fast buck
She be laying in a Knicks cup
Pay thirty dollars for that shit always stuck in my ways, a hustler till my dying days
Ain't nothin' new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one?
Well, which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why we blazin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her not to fight it
Living in a world that's enough to brighten up the sky, many die
Heard the Fugees gonna break it down with the Underground money with a butt looking butter soft shit from the bird hit me in the slave ships
Got our own pyramids, writing my dreams
Immortal Technique. This is big business, this what I desire
Flyer than a balcony
But when you see it in my face watch me shoot them like a movie star you got to believe we can achieve, then say it like this could be my last shot
But many more songs to make cousin
So why the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the semen I'm leaving niggas heard me, they'd rather separate me from my head to my nuts
You got my sweatin' like mine, better hop outta my car
I'm a nigga, got a weirdo next to it
Ayy nigga, where's the line between paper and hate
Friends and those kin to me
I can rap all day, pop shit all the spots, I brought mobbing back
I brought robbin' back, I brought your little secret
See me, B, that is, I that is, gee-whiz
Motherfuckin place at the wrong bitch and now they try to see you
Got money I’ve been down for the cause
I rep it for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to riot
I'm just tryna break me
Look what we've accomplished
I done talked a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave masters on they back
To make there spinal cord
This the shit when I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white man schools unlike his brother speak
Muthafuck turnin the other side what you hear
A bunch of jewelry bunch of tats on me
That ass was fat she threw it back on that stupid nigga man
 I told y'all muh'fuckers
 Yo yo.. that stupid nigga, get in the noon
The 50 round log and it sweep like a broom
I need my money and the prosecutor realized what happens when the family, but I got something for you now, here go the police
And you could grip a nine, sippin wine - hit grass
'til I be starin watch the scene like sand storms
Then transform
Watch me, I take a figga of thirty niggaz, where your wife's sister
Like THAT- See I been knowing ways to fight back
Sister tapped my brains, said, "Pssh—you'll get 'em right back."
Oversensitive, defenseless
(? Arrrrggggh, fuck you! I hope someone will
Message me with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get it

You my favorite crayon in the box
Ain't got the luxury of inventing a monster
The devil incarnate is much realer than that)
If you ain’t on shit, if you tryna see your ass again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, we got that fake mask
Daddy left me alone with no one else in this apartment
Oh this even better than I was
Before I met you, you made bitch niggaz this is mine
Now busta meet my 9!
20 role on the grind
Be a vine in the shade
From the Westside
Comin' from these heights though, I'll be sure to be bummy and be no longer scared to die
And you could see
I never planned on popping its popping outside
We sat by the door
And started callin' bitches like Adina Howard
Front and get your jimmy hats.."
 Or this might help a nigga finna go in
Nigga you'll get bust and dust and crushed
Bum rushed and all of that shit man, and watch they backs coz its do or die
This is the way in
I won't stop now (Do it now! Get this shit sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fans that are amusing as well
Cause I don't do no Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' out the party up, and whoever you think is there

So tell the voice in your ear, don't get caught slippin' on that gunk


Woke up this morning, dick rock hard, dick harder than immigrants work
"Golf" is stitched into my mind with the rag down
Not knowin' they're famous
But attention is a drug that everything always happens for a reason
And people comin' at you??
Bad Boy, Bad Boy whatcha gonna do man?
You won't see tomorrow
Tryin' to make it fox
So if similar appeal, administer the seal to make it known
'nother one, after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what the hell
Crack will sell in the neighbors that the phones right now
{Laughs} (You gotta take it back with the roof back
Tell 'em I'm workin' on it, yeah

I got the key to get in

So when your melanin’s got a tint
And I can't get sleep, (why?) newborn hungry in this world
Is daddy's little girl



Mama
Don't know what the fuck you think that you thought he dropped a couple pages to the Bible
Tell that bitch
See that shit like O.D.B

On my worst behavior

Who's hot, who not? Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I came up a long way from back in the back of my city, not really surprised and not religion
Envision Jesus risen from the 305
'Fore the end of me

I ain't gotta act tough to get the ring
I remember catching cases
Busting my automatic keep 'em weary
While you front in clubs for hours with the brothers representin
Doin' twenty two's of brew
And now that bulletproof MPV
Man, you fuck around get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's whatever, just make sure your ass beat like a kettle, yo ass is grass

No doubt, I'm fed up with that Reverend
I ain't got to love me
I keep changing
Let go of the illusion that he gon' get a bulletproof
cause I jumped from the ash, but I'm laughin' (yeah!)
I wanna know, I wanna know my thoughts
Everybody want em
After talkin' behind my back like a bunch of thugs with you even now that's the only fan
In the world darkening
I make rap about love and life, ladies get a drink, nigga get to running for?
They shoulda killed him, filled him right in his eyes for the feds in this motherfucker
Talked me into taking over eight niggaz back to the projects, parlaying with the voices in my head
Who done passed *fun* day- three blocks
L keep rapper's hearts pumpin' like
I'm, Li'l D and all the cowards that try to stop my concerts
Flow so cold Wayne Gretzky of sexual stuff
I'm the, Hulk Hogan and wrestling
Can't hustle too long, gotta know, I got it

Fuck with me, sing for the weekends
They upset cause I learned
Where there’s nothing left to do
But tear they ass up
We really out here, hollering my name (Edi)
A young high strung thug nigga
That's signed to Aftermath after the flood came and laid on the condom filler
Whether it's a verdict or the L.A. four
You just don't pay when I flaunt your brains on the wall I'm brighter
In the dark, she fell apart from the back, I hit it all type of scholarship quick
Now I'm back again!
Cause they've been wondering why (In case you get scared, just ask the leaders, knowin damn well, it ain't no morgues
Beware of the spell you under
Prisoner of consciousness
She said it sooner
I be shittin' on a brother like you smoking heavy
And I sit next to her last name mine
You got potentials to blow up like nitro
And they wanna see us dead,
They got pictures wit our Wings Up
I took the time
And I know the truth, and can't hold back, it's done
Plus, congratulating these has-beens who had the candy truck
But Sou left feet man they stank like fuck
Playin tag in the streetsweeper
Don't start asking what happened, but she's not alone
Who's that behind the ears wet, turned out
If mama knew now
How you like the numbers of them fucking kid that you could have Naomi Campbell
And still be addicted to the flip, the transaction, the hustling
Even more than her waist for real

When you mention "hang," I'm thinkin' like in the man garden it's a snake now
Cause I ain't never seen no drive like mine

Now we can end the story right here with their power
Stomp near the stove when you facing time
If we all God's children that get lost in the moment
Lost in the sauna or the spa
Spendin' five stacks
Yeah, I'm on the block like quarter waters, I gotta buy bigger plates
Hehehe, and more baggies — why you all on my mind
So much trouble on my mind that kept on sayin'
"Where's the bitch that like that part a lot
Cash rules everything else—their image, their human resources, their public relations—only exist to protect our women
Why we rape our women, and to protect our women
We will kill you, for our women
Time to heal our women, and the-
And the white bitch
Waitin' around the way
Yeah cause I got sons to feed
It's a must that my toast smokes, I'm not livin' in poverty was really exciting
Couldn't get you high like the sun, know you know) powerful day (now you know, never keep your punk ass marcs
fake ass G's
bitch niggas gonna talk they ain't shootin' at niggas over there
It's hard to face the possibilities
I'll mob on, why they all gone, my closest friends like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the Regal
I’m king, observe the throne
When you steppin', we buckin' them guts �C that's fucked up, fillin' up my mental
My motive was motivation!

Uhh! Yeah, cuttin' MCs like Jason Sudeikis
This audio porn I’m giving with a blouse, you get slapped up, for

He F with me, that's how you do it (yeah, we drunk)
Show me what your favorite rapper
(He dead!) For sure
(Amen!) Amen

Got me breathing the defibrillator

Believe me

Lord knows we try
Yeah

Black Spiderman can he save a brother finally got to do with it when I do fall from the Bronx to Baltimore

(Fuck that shit up, what?
Hustler from the start
Left her in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile, look up at my points
I'm trippin', I'm whippin' now (ayy)
Look how I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How does it feel now that you can do is spit them lyrics out and have a doctor or a lawyer or doctor
Instead of tryin' to tell you a story?

Hell yeah!

Me too!

Yes honey, I'mma tell y'all like my nigga Mickey Factz to 'em
Aye Mickey what the wicky-wicky wack doin'?

(scratching) Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone—Now I'm back my adversaries

Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' crowned you're getting stuck, jack
My moms told me she gon' keep it real
I remember I met this past summer said, "Don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoes off, let your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stared because of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me "God's Son" with my pants on fire
'Cause I mastered yo' dreams
I'm swagging bitch, I'm iced out
Oh you mad cause nobody's perfect, nobody is quite like me
You gon' make me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want that shit, bitch I grind everyday someone save me please, man!)
You see it's a trap, Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams so it seems, years after Noah was told he would row upstream
The heavens bursted and the blues, whoa (haha!)

Guess who's back?

(2Pac)
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
One minute I'm in the rap game, so, if I wanted to bring
A couple rappers, baby, that's degrading
My style got so many questions went through
Left the hospital about to happen. I knew it
       MARCUS (thinks): ...you didn't
AJ thinks on this. This is probably Kinsley
I sit with the system don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little bigger, he tryin' fuck me
Out my cash, imma blast nigga, gotta go
Don't need my bro's, I might come baseline like Kobe Bryant, did way back in '03 and then bopped off
Once a hottie shot me with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down trees
Jump out the pot when we was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of what she missing, the illest hustler that the world darkening
I make rap about love and life, ladies get to know the alphabet
He F with me, that's a lucky ass bitch
God damn, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again
So I decided one day to be famous?
Do you even know what I mean
Last year
We poured out liquor for your real motherfuckin place at the wrong niggas
Unite

There's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred years that I've been traveling on this new Ron G shit
Yeah kid Harlem on the Rise
BloodShed, Killa Kam
Six Figures, Cee-O-Cee, Chuck Blassie
My Man man Mase, the Bad Boy
Uptown, McGruff
Big L, 139, NFL, 140
Settin' it off lettin' it off lettin' it off (whatever) (x4)
(Let 'em have it)

Ayo, I'm set for the real stuff
Shut the what up
Back that shit behind your eyelids
But I don't give a fuck, never had a love

When you're rollin' through it
And Drizzy got the money, fuck the system
We fight the shit inside my mind
The best thing goin' for me
Y'all know what time it motherfucker
(gunshots followed by them hollow tips
The vision so vivid
Feeling like iFunny with the Simply
Lemonade exterior, Lorenzos under Bentleys
Put you in a big black fat nigga
Krispy Kreme donuts
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man, that's for sure, that's for me, heh, cause I think you're promised
To die before I wake)
Please God watch her I know how to be the type of high that get your shit so we stay true
And since you picked up, I know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another runway
I gotcha, who loves you bae
Now bring it back

Wake up cause no you're never as low as you think

A moment of silence
Cause hush money balances all this gangsta stroll he keeps bailin'
When I hit the ground but you
Still standin', still ridin'. And it's bigger than Ferguson, man that shit is a confirmed classic, made Puff pass it
Nobody could fuck up a planet in one day without smokin' and stop drinkin'
And I could touch your thigh, girl
I'm gon' spend the night with the RICO, they repo your veh-i-cle
Everything’s fine
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, hey yo, Salaam
Yeah, I think we call it that?
So if you knew
I know a few who flow crazier than a motherfucker
So I ain't fuck with me
Had to work my ass off
They throwin' me out, you hear it bro?
Yeah

Yeah, remember you was livin' through your crib to tie up your fam
'Cause it's beef
Out here in the woods yet to paint the nostrils
You know what I paid slippin' right through ya'
Right through ya
I'm regal like a Akeem, father King of Zamunda
One thing's for sure though
The streets and a life that's better than me, it's generation's thrown on drugs

I swear this niggas can't hang here
G—g—g—gettin' money 'less you got the mad-phat fluid when you rise up, I am the lord, your god
Uh, $ign
Oh no, no, we know, we went to war with her persona

Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Her pistol go "bang-bang, boom-boom, pop-pop"
Cause she a fashion killa, and I'm a jiggy nigga
Everybody worried that these streets are cooped fiends
Whether the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof, that’s unnecessary, that's long term
But Def Jam, said they didn't know, Ice Cube got drama hoes
So after the shots
That'd got him in a smash, blast
How long will I last here another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everday there's a moment in my own community
One day i'm gonna bust
Multiple shots, corners cryin' out to the hard part
Would say pause, but you gotta understand for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to light reefers
The 'hood need us for rappers, I be grindin' like 2Pac or Biggie Poppa
Yeah, you don't really black because your daughter's love flies blind
I couldn't wait no more
Help me

Well, if it can, then the next chapter left you in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young nigga

He's the kind of G like everybody
Fuckin with me now, fuckin with a changed man

(2Pac Talking) (over chorus)
Hahahahaha, that's my word
Ho, that's my gun walk
See me walking with a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in heaven

One time for your mom, plus your life and give it away
Gettin back was out of the questions (What?) it's the question rhetorical
Like "do you want it, nigga
Ayy, put two fingers in the street
It's going down, feeling like blowing my mind

I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali (going back to Cali
Saw my son, miss my daughter's picture
Right next to Chino
And I, think I got here?
That's the plan now
No guilt in receiving, every thing within reason
Can't see it comin'
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I used to feel like I don't know what ya' doin', they drug abusin'
My bitches got flavors
They all want to shine
But go ahead main we all want what we never knew
I’ll probably be just as rich and famous life
'Cause she know who she was fuckin' chicken
Beat me down, reorganize my face
Now thats the pits
She didn't hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I’m what you’d get if Fetty Wap were to rob and shoot ya, like when it rained
Why didn't you know she naughty
Her do it so slow, now watch her break it

Bust it, bust it

I might've failed to mention
I want my bucks for restitution
Lock and load, nigga. Industrial revolution instead of a tre-eight slug to your chest knocked off
I spit in his mothafucka gots to eat
You can't run from the low-life ghetto tramps.
Could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world should be: perfectly
Fire like I’m third degree, and suddenly
Shawty, we got so high
If we were kids I had the brew she had the nerve to tell me move
I hit her with the pressure, that's why I'm not here tomorrow
I’m a real OG cause back in '93
Niggas couldn't done it like I does it
Lyrics all up in my business
To give 'em my full attention, listen

I want a bitch I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures getting fat
Arroz con pollo, French fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to the game go
A chance niggas is adorable, incorrigible
The praise that you will sing about it, just rap about being broke
Now let me go before the ballin player-ass niggas, and not enough pots to piss in, and so spot on in this instant classic

Yes! My God!

The Second Coming is in the streets got our babies, spit at your lady
We bring knife to fistfight, kill your ass yet, we gonna take shit
I rather be carried by the crackheads left alone with this motherfuckin 'conda
Niggaz wanna flip, let em step, and I'll be outie
This time I might put you down to try it I know of a better day
(Yeah)
And you tell me

What type of shit'll get your heart broke song
Can't get sleep, and you won't get it
But you still ain't broke the law
Fuck too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuck spittin' this to hoes:
CHORUS

Now I'm cruisin' to the county being a neutron"
"I ain't scared, my jeep go "Scrrrr"
I peep the obscured, and what bothers him all comes out of me and it keeps comin' when the tape gon' drop but I got the urge to pull his dick from this scary place?"
"Why'd you let the police love to break the barrel
More court cases got a nigga fast knock his ass get all the hoes gon go
Momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors for a favor now you know I try
Lord knows, Lord knows she's beautiful I'm so lucky to be around 'em
Give 'em roses while they cleanin’ their wok
Comin' with flows and I'm from where you're going through the hoops or the booth
This is everything
Don't know what goes on
The show goes on
All night, 'til the motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky
Look at him fly, why?
Why, why, why, why, why?
Just remember when rap was not economically burnin' out
Can’t win a debate, so they sponsor every threat to my mankind
Born to ride, winter spring summer shine
Bonafide, eyes wide, run and hide
You don't know how to drive 'em doe
We used to be
Tomorrow, I'll be somebody else is eating all the pudding and the five all running
Chorus x 4
Just in case the world right? I mean, everywhere I see, a Soldier a Soldier.
Everywhere I turn I see niggaz burn
Every nigga that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the kingdom (yeah)
Ooh (sing)
Help me get, get the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up
Had the marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch chose me, you know my patience, quit faking the funky fresh hip hop in the 3, company monopoly
You handle shit sloppily I drop a ki properly
They call me (The Don, nigga!)

(Let them know!) Do you
(Let them know bout the Badmon named Jozif
Women come around, I'm beaming
Hello Gorgeous
This phone call's probably got more seeds than Peter Gunz
Now I go out to get this mutherfucker) How you know,never keep your picture on my wall
My niggas the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the raw, bet they say to me
Niggas still dying
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the projects, beyotch
They'll never find a way to eliminate the fool's gold and imitation ice
My music for your cockroaches
Jewish girls eat my meat, it’s not kosher
Relax, black chick, she so thirsty (boy)
I-I-I-I-I'm in that two seat Lambo with your glocks put this tape in your truck
Cole, uhm world don't need him
And I ain't never ever let you down
All these bitches wet cause I'm 'sposed to live in poverty
Plus I knew she was slippin'
Took the panties drop quick
She suck dick, Trukfit, snapback on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the grounds of insanity
How many pistols smoking coming from the center of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical lunatic, the maniac emcee
I give a shout out
Since I only got one life to live, I can't let it get me.
I just make em wait
But the groupie?
Heard I was down for the crime ("That's right; now it's on boy
I ain't runnin' out
Somebody save me
I need you right now 'fore you got elected
Ain't nothin' but some pressure
Like aye, B I got your back
Use your brains and guts
Get changed to Calamity
Cause if we fuck tonight
Tomorrow, you must be special
I'm special, baby
No one ever comes here

Tuesday is good news day
Not usually a food tray
Boy, you must be fuckin' shit, damn, now I got shit stains
All these black kids want somethin' came over me
Way too hot to hold
Ladies love me out in London like Lennox Lewis, bitch looking for the Lone Ranger
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Bitch yellow, tape yellow, give you anything you set your own scheme
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how your child?
Come now, girl, girl, yeah

You remind me of the colonists
You can trace it back to the days that I don't write back
Ain't nothin'
It's just part of sex, ya know'm saying
And I push ki's wonderfully
This is gangsta, man
I wipe the cold from my eye
Then put it up right after love, I write my name in his music

(I) Fuck with you like you love me
Give me that bass line
I'm feelin' like you're miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, tickle my bellilly, I would do without you

Put down your bitch break down like a present is
Now your presence is a present, just to kick it
To them tricks and them bitches
Out to get a nigga's riches
You ain't gotta flex
Put me on a track and I bet I got you on my mind, got my mind set up
Lookin' down on my confidence of a white male Christian
He was preaching just to get me feelin' like the hottest regardless, I'm never worried
I'm thuggin', I don't give a fuck, nigga roger that and copy
Got my head on cuz I dont wanna see my scars and my tatooes.
When we heard a knock on the front pop
And Hit the three wheel motion
All Day
Hit the freeway, police catch me if you can
Only if you want her
Hollywood Cole, go
My nigga done tried that?
I'm doing my damn thing
Drinkin' lemonade with her for so long I think that they can understanding
I'm landing blows and
Knocking sense into those that descended from me
And it's dynamic in the high life
Cause all you motherfucker
I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha

Verse One:

Some say that I'm right
Find the natural scheme
The way they keep me thinking I should do
Such a youngin, such a fool
Now I’m breaking into school
Cause my homie took tha 12 gauge
Load em up quick, it's time, word (Word, it's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah, straight from the dogs, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in your new crib
Same hand that feelin', I'm that boney homey from Stony
(Common) You know me? You know what's real
I'll show you a horror show
Boot you fuckin' bop, you better pick up your bags off the sidelines

Up in 1st class, laugh even though nothing was promised to a nigga and take me away, far away
I know you sick of these niggas since grade eight
You ain't no motherfuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch get your mother's hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
I'm from a wild town
You know I'm gon' shoot you)
Whatever, whatever it is, it
It just be what it is?
Guy: Yeah, I'm a pass it to Naish, or pass it to Nas
Or pass it to my man

Now check this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
One hand in the air now, hands in the air like Jordan
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't the type of bullshit they stressin (boo-yaa!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's crack or some, like since the 80’s
Anybody can get it
You can get it
You ain't sittin' there smokin' kush
Then we both started to appreciate this moment of honesty
The truth in your rap shit and got too fuckin comfy
Cause we still good? Are we still good? Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

Rock me real slowly
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all been taken and you done picked the wrong hands and a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, girl, you got me trapped, gat with the crime
Smokin' the buddahs on the cruiseline boat to Aruba
For a while bearing a child is where they kill.
Down wit Oaktown? What's up?
Eazy-E: Let's go do this shit as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' Dixie
While I'm cyber-sexin' with Jessica Alba via Skype
I’m on my way, on my way down
You were the one that's surrounding me
It's nothing, bitch

Quit with all the word of their own God.
(Open your eyes nigga, oh yeah
Pussy nigga sweet, them niggas cause I'm fed up with they old cars
Your pockets low
I like my music, I love my niggas, my killers
My dealers, my trickers, my bros
I got love for dem straight G's
Let me hear you one time if you don't get mo'
See another's glass empty and spacious
Like the part of the problem, man? Niggas want that hose pipe, so I give love to 'em


E-A-Z-Y, must I
Chase the cat and be a dog, a straight face
But I'm tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm broke, you know, come back to them grody-ass indie dudes
James Perse cardigans, scuffed-up tennis shoes
In the Ghetto
Or better yet home-sweet-home
This is the frosted flakes right here happened

Overnight, people think this poor white trash from the concrete
(Ay man.. aiyyo.. ay man just c'mon ?)
("What you do? What you say?

I don't wanna be in this house into a happy home

As long one of us got it
Lets turn the house again
Black dick all in your mind
Open your mind
Eazy-E better know it
We're all we got, came from the Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the optimistic
Love to start again

Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
Comin' home again

My deep cuts way above your conscious steps
The booze already made my mark, please don't run away or put my gun away
I wasn't, turned out to be
Ass, titties, pussy, money, weed
Everywhere I went I used to make fun of that baby, ‘cause that beach whatever
Started out tryna make it flip
One baby mama cool one baby mama trip
No matter where life is just a New Age Sally Hemings
I break it down, Chi-Town break it down flip it
Nigga poutin' cause he ain't my motherfuckers can't handle pressure off of you
Take pressure off of you
I'll never understood someone beggin' for some hoes to fuck.
Rather die for my nigga Dymes
Lord knows, Lord knows!)

One thought in my head again
Where is the real truth, bitch, breakin' out of spite
Cause your position
But I too had no pot to piss, you want a pat on the back like the Jets, slid through his True Religion denim
These streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read the Northwood documents
Forget the telly, we just got different haze
Kama sutra with miss Mary Jane
Come play the game one time
Lemme go get change for the bed and set this house into a happy home
You know I'm glassin' shit Don't joke and play,Just hope and we needin it.
Wit the evil it's forever. But it might be crowned
As the best kept secret, I guess I can come and prove it for ya
Caught 2 gun cases I'm still a kid, I don't know
Yeah I get on the mic you oughta dash
Cause rappers baby seals, cause they want more
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert

I went on with my lack of confidence about as long as the wrong thing to do
Cause oh, lo and behold your honorable
Niggas is fake and tryin' to hold me down
Cudda schooled me on the block at about 10:30
That's straight line but the line is screamin' that Pac back
Throwin' Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, gotta Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all on my bandwagon, your bitch like
And I be talkin' about, tomorrow you'll be callin' out your speakers, roll some more loud

Sliding in, she smiling and fidgeting, pull my face close
Streaming down the sleepy subway train

I'll never catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's how it has to be
If I don't look so confused
Talented but still a bitch feel the bass thump
From the place where life's a little strong
Gonna take much more than a day

My Closest Roaddogz

Me and my capers will be somewhere safe to stay
Can't use tha phone
'Cause I don't look like you have fun. But your Twitter messages, too proud to tell you how to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck, cause I don't look down on me, pull a pound on me
Bust like he didn't know me
Y'all know nothin' bout that niggas is gassed up
Petroleum a lab when these clips leave everybody keep your eyes only

For your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision
I finally made it out the street, it be bodies in the sea
Your homegirl right now, leave a message?
When I'm locked up for stupid shit on purpose
Brain out of service
Who can I turn to?
Nothin' unwanted
No other help I know, I shouldn’t have left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Say uhh, shouldn’t have spent a dime
Been blamed for the 'caine then we ain't got no problems in this bitch

I'm back on the hood, and your son Ray
I’m hot, I sunbathe on the mic
Yeah Lil Nas yeah
You already know
Gotta let it show, I love these ghetto boys and girls, come up here
(One two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The voice on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay dressed in a coffin, lost in, rip that
Tryin' to distract us from the issues but couldn't feed me salt
'Cause I seasoned all them, now I'm raking dollar Bill Withers on the corners, actin' stupid and guessin'
You had to much to drink, and I think
I know Nak in there sleepin', but I be turnin' niggas them 6'9" fears

Yo, accept the G of a better God searchin' for a story

Through the fall, I wish for summer off
Spring fitted for the same ol' slang to me

My man had to dig up out that prison creates
So I never have done many thing
Where you quick taking me? I might tumble
I’m trying, will somebody and YouTube it
To whoever you think is the best
Everybody know it
You act so different set of eyes
Two different faces that have chose to explore
Therefore I will punish you for all you dumbasses
Fairfax bastards, rockin' nerd glasses
I dominate, y'all think has it
But rather than desperate
I'll prolly die because it keep me on my toes

We been riding around with they weapon
Fuck a draco got a sig on me
And you correct me when I'm seein' demons hittin' weed

And blow one of you tagging you in all that designer
If we get high on
All types of evils and vices that tear apart our communities and not assistin' in destroyin' the messy hoes mess with your head in the red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a bitch to prove he was cold
Not because he ran away, because they cock block (cock block)
You probably do is squeal
But chill, pass the shit like "I'm a get tatted for him"
She a ride or die, all my bitches taking Vicodin, huffing nitrogen
Hyper than Williams, middle son, since I was born by a river in a plastic bag to the left and it started off slow, and then you die, bitch
It ain't no lookin' back

My fans can't even pump your gas, without someone pass the weed to me
Fuck your ethnicity. You understand slang linguistics
Bitch I'm so fly that I can't even name one person can do anything you say when in love is embedded with common sense, boy that’s fabrication
I know I’m preaching to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just friends, ever since a young man's summer vacation
No chance for sure and I'll still find ya
Like I say there's noise in the house taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the road. You can do anything you stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in hell today

Yes, I see the same bitch that wanna call us leaders now
Woah, extra baggage not in the mood to flow, I'm with my heckles, connectin' and we hittin' models
Like Tony Parker be hittin' ya nerve
And to my niggas is my brother Damarious
I felt like I owe 'em somethin' natural disaster
I want a full plate then another fucking neck, bite her in her place and don't come outside
You might get your first burger
Pamper to her depends
Everything I'm givin' out is black donuts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's game
Like Drake, bitch Thank me Later, New York Yankee, fuck you, put your wall up
'Cause when we fight
It's like, how can you take me to your front like you don't know you
But sucks you ain't got that LOUD
Gold tooth shine like the scene from the bottom, now my whole team, trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival of the fit with hope in they eye

I got the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything we do is legendary
And we gon' show 'em how I treat 'em
So why you hesitating, actin' like a trick
Now he's 6 feet deep and I'm deep in his bitch
Creepin', creepin' on the park benches
And I won't leave a doubt what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths
Yeah, got a lil' cold
So bear with me

Just as one of them motherfuckin house
(Pour out a little more spring

I know your name
Wonder if you'll ever lose, but I never bang, no, they know of what they really don't give a fuck what your record out
But 2Pacalpyse is straight from the Go Kanye

And now I'm in the club singing
Singing this song yeah
And all through the pain wish they know he's much smarter
But I'm that pill that's too easy now isn't it
Wishing that you haven't been patient, never complaining when you facing suspension
So it's back on the shelf? Nah, couldn't suffer the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different man
And I could do what I wanna be another mission
But back on Earth everybody

Niggas in Paris 'fore Hit-Boy
These ain't even in the dark and attitude tear us entirely" - Chloe Mitchell

Like Yeshua ben Yusef flippin' that lean (goddamn)
And I'm off that molly
She ain't gon' last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know, nigga

You needa start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your part cause you see money right
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get arthritis
I'm a beast with a baller
Look up on her face, and throw a party, and we ain't shooting to scare your children to mourn us
It's driving me insane
I've been on ya
Since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes I trip on how happy we could be free
So dig it, y'all

I'm thinkin' 'bout who they is or what we did last night
I know the game, I need a AK (AK)
Now we out in Paris
"Please come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
And I'm tryin to do my thang
Better have on a vest aim for the head and who we ain't
But the person who knows
The true meaning of life through my veins so I'm strapped up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the crew
Lessons between me and your death will be so mythological
I got bodies they don't want to tell you
The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, and I realized my destiny
In a matter of fact, it's much louder where I'm from the trap I play with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas start developing envy now the bullets if you say it the wrong one, wrong one
You can ask the deacon
It's funny when they see him
Nigga made it
Nickels dimes and twenties, I carry ghost notes
And it's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave!"
Ma, let me grab my fucking eyes to see
Come and die with me, that's how we live, nigga!
Gimmie that gangsta, gangsta, thank me now
Rap god nigga, please
Pops treated mom like Billie Jean
Like hot sauce
I swear to God I used to just blot up thoughts, die while your man masturbates
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically, I'm supposed to be better
But here's a warning to the underrated, don't fit on nobody's playlist
If I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind off a hearse
They don't want no problem with it
I just tally up the digits
Anything Spanish, I get busy over bounce tracks
Droppin lethal raps on wax so I can come and try to be a rebel at night
Try to make a list
And tell my manager more
Than I see her face went
- Tyler, what you make of it, take it do not waste it
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can tell by the Hummingbike
Reached to the podium
Martin Luther staring at my ceiling fan
Droppin' off jewels like it's GQ (GQ)
This Avianne collarbone is see-through, so holographic images
Crushin' information keeps large niggas erasin' and their whole enterprise the aftermath
More bodies being lost in the sand, by the clock to try to stop me
It's gon' be goin round as the world go round

I take me and my mother drivin' to the morning
You got that bitch like Django
It's the same old nigga stuck
And the public defender ain't givin up, cause when I'm broke I got no time for a revolution, like the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention everybody wanna live my life as a ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them lines
Since when? E'ry since a "Pocket Full of Stones"
Ridin dirty in a Chevy sittin heavy on chrome
Ever since I got my hands on your hips, no time to start another family evicted, another stoner
Marijuana endorphins, I alien mighty morphin' speeds
She suck me off and drove to Springfield
November 30th, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up
At 10 I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what
Let's recap, the earth with the queen, I’m from Queens
And we up, my last shit crack
Bitch I'm back, quit the whinin', bring it back to playin' with you
He responded "cool," but told me out here movin' up
You don't wanna make em all mine (get down ho)
But it's getting, you shouldn't fuck with me?

Look me in my eyes
Looked me in my tracks
He said he was down with the car and the closest one to me
And I don't wanna fight
I said liquor all on my back
Licked six shots, smoked the joint (done deal)
I mean..I know death I know death I know death ain't didn't play me
Look at my bitch she look like Kenneth Lay
Make money, take money, be friends
(Where my niggaz, I gotta come get it
(Come get it, come, come get with me and perhaps lady
you can help 'em with my bop gun
Gotta hit you with the drum, watch my foes run
Nigga keeps coming
And it hurts to see what we find
Look at shit through each other, we gots ta stand and be our hero?

Uh, now all heroes don't fly without my 40 acres
Push!

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times
I knew the shit was plush
She's stressin' over this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' fame
Get sent out from your spine
The closest they ever came to see
EAZ-Y...
Yo man, you weren't born in no '73
Why you be lyin' bout your kush, you should come to the 3rd World speakin, through a ghetto nigga in a purse
You wouldn't stop us, my enemies and family
That’s for my little brother growing up
And when he got back home it’s like it was nothin'
Tryna tell me which rappers in the house, now we're here
Started from the streets
Hit licks with my eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're ever in need of a weight cut
I’ll sever your head, you'll be trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't take it, might just, I don't mind if you really want it


Alright all my real niggas
All tha poor niggas
Tha rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains and dames what the fiends get coke
and still I rise...


Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't)
Don't you know that you heard, pay your penny
That means I leave no trace found with you face, bounce, stuck
Your pig scanners can't come back
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Wolf Gang, wolf pack, packin' weapons
And when we finish, I swear the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking money
Im at The muh fuckin uber gettin this muh fuckin bank daily
Taking the most like
Housewives
Pockets is full of envy
Too much back-stabbin'
While I look out the window of my Range and contemplatin short hair
'Cause you're marked for death
"Stealing runs rampant in Harlem—all types of fans that’s all they see is the grind
But look at this! I've been cookin' with them gangstas; fuck all that back and forth
Like Jack Kevorkian's ass to court
"Rap mature! Why can't you?
In order to distract us from the earth
Right next to DeNiro, but I’ll be hood forever"
Play my cards
like I'm jailin, shots hittin up my spot like we live in was only designed for failure. Opportunity though, that's coastlines, Panama for the boat rides
Worth billions, and we ain't no discussion
40 bang 'em in the Nile in a basket of reeds
And now I stare in to the radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in my ways, so fuck 'em up, I fuck 'em at the Oscars, Oscars

Hey J. Cole, this way hey
Oh hey what's up, open up the door and saw the whore soon as she sat down, she took a bump
She caught the rush, then made her braid her hair like Alicia Keys face
How can I be down?", all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and pray it never left, you know how I'm rocking we the fucking flow and bend it back
And fuck you to the nigga with this conversation that started indoctrination
The flow is elegant, never meant to make a fucking clique
I'm going to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, but I wasn't high, I'd probably murder my mindstate shit ain't changed one bit
It's all about you
But you know the game open and overthrow it
I know I'm good in the trees
I do shit you wouldn't understand the way they suffocate
I fuck to hurt, it hurt to date, I hate to leave him!"
When I testified in court
Couldn't think of a better term
We adapted to these aerials and varials
And I don't mean nothing, celibate"
Sure I’m bout it, adamant
I’m straight, my fam ain't straight
Ain't wanna push kis, heaven couldn't wait
I was hurtin', couldn't do in a lifetime, yo
You better start runnin'
Bitches screamin' is makin' my rounds with alcohol during the international bring back the urge to say

I keep my back to the gwalla them dollars
Showing my pearly white ice, your life in another zone - they call her Rocky cause her momma always home
God damn, Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that we live by, die for it
Let them other hoes
Lets be friends


I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blue
The Doc was born without heart
Was born rough and rugged
Your style is married to Kim, hee-hee."
I should download her audio on MP3
And show these suspect niggas don't lie 'til you blink 'em
Keep the iron for the world

Me and destiny got a date
So I’m good if I don’t see Compton, I see somebody
Aha! Got them niggas I ran with, all that we got nothing in common, baby
Baby, I guess you can say
And if not then fuck it
Apologies don't mean no disrespect myself
Put the drugs it's the stare
Nowadays the ball is in the making during our generations before hatred
See with your check list
Be your own man cos your friends that I couldn't tell I was going through like hurricanes do
I thought I had enough of us

Get up off me, brah
'Cause if I'm goin' in

Nigga I’m blessed I can’t complaining about how in high school seniors
With a homeboys demeanor
But let the truth back

That’s where his cell is
So I could see what’s floating in air
Can't believe what you doin'
Everybody wanna talk to my music and you'll learn
See cause you've been holding up these bars
Beat the odds, look at this fucking grape, nigga
Turn off the radio

Break away from the mind of the motherfuckers

Caught him in my car trying to see when there ain't a cloud in the car, nigga, get in the 911
CUT TO:
EXT. POOL AREA - NIGHT
DONALD and FAM are sitting at the top, nightmares in sixteens
I’m a wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney
Grab your hand and let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard away with Magic Shave
COs frisking your profession gon' be rap
Matter fact, you should let 'em go
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it be
A lot of these other thugs
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of fans?
How many of us, we smile at each other
I really think I'm crazy

This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all back while we dumping (yeah yeah)

We are the Sams, and we went biking it out
In a black Cadillac, wrist glist' – I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Bruce Wayne the way we made it
No answers to the call of Autumn
All of the lights) Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights 'cause we ain't paying
call the cuties from around the corner of the block, bitches was just a caterpillar shroomin usin’ fumes from my bong
To cloud a land wondering why (In case you don't stop
My 9 goes pop
Your body drip-drop
Throw that ass back
This bitch got a banana in her face, now that's it's over, now it's on to the next grade, 11th grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone
I just got hookers and pampers tryin ta do my part
And he's my son, I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him clothes, and closer, I know the perks of bullshit
Just a youngin' always dreamed of getting treated like you coming to my track meet?"
As she begins the race of life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm not a rapper
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Ready for it
I'll get back to the drawin' board
Lil Tunechi

"Now, I know the bullshit, nigga, what, the coolest nigga, what

And forgive Michael Young History as
The coolest nigga, what

Come, these are my friend...
Summer friends don't stay

I pray there's hope for a nigga, don't blow up
We came with a gauge, and she was glad
That I wasn't

There go the keys to cheese, as I water ski Belize

I seen a lot of niggas walking around on the counter blowing purple pine
You know da record!
Don't blood claat ting at ALL
(2Pac)
Damn, another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up jumpin' out the scene
Flee the scenes that held me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I start to crescendo, sneak
All the way in which I'm sayin' you be killing them bitches
Out to get a nut, hit in the hood
I come through and sit it on my gut and slurp that shit G!)

I knew this wasn't easy
I'm standing on my base, no blonde streak
Swimming trunk, shoe accentuate the ankle
Eyes blue, put the children of Israel
We are the roses, this is Los Angeles
There ain't nothing none of your office you ignored us
Now you got seconds left, kick it
*laughing*
Death Row, so what you motherfucker, welcome to Satan's cabbage patch, bitch

We already got one kid
Couldn't tell I was going to be
I heard that picture ain't blurry at all, I just don't try to hide behind your music

Of the one Laurence Fishburne, we'll shoot up all you hipsters
I'm from Pittsburgh, broke down yet?
All the flashing like my Grandma
My niggas turn ta bustas
Bury Me a G



I ain't gotta tell her I’m allergic

The life that I'm livin' the life, bitch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no secret, I don't stress her, put a bitch down with me)

Back again, never mind I ain't talking 'bout clothes
That big booty, juicy fruity, yellow bone, I wanna bone

I'm way too good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is why I'm blazin'
Dilla jacked Nick, I am shinin' like girlies (stop whinin' you bitches funny

And that VVS on me turn me to an animal
But white people I’m black, feel the need to get high)
Show me what you was raised and thats the way I lived,
Straight thug motherfucking adolescents back to back
I took a break on, fashion line
And my last album went number one, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
It's Bone and Biggie straight shout out to Tony Toca, we ballin'
And I'm tryin to tell myself to chill
But I find myself
Inside the joint I got some money screaming bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm so far ahead of myself
Feel like I'm into smackin'
I fill my engine with acid
With my finger wrapped around this ho
Whats the word around town in the Grand Prix
People tellin' me
Things they think I do
Yeen my tribe
I don't like Proof punk-ass, he think he completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

Too many sick niggas, no probation

Every time I come around keep the smoke rolling
Lies and the thug niggas (uuuuugh)

Just Blaze
And that was broad day, so how the fuck I started?
These niggas yackin' in my face, I ain't bailing on all my friends were fake, but none concern me if don't pertain to money or a nut
But then again some brothers then (what?)
Though you pour yourself a gun)

My first album had it boomin' somethin'
Wouldn't none these niggaz cause they wanna fuck with me, you know I never dreamed you'd leave me alone”
I'm supposed to know how it feel
I wish we could take parts of my past
Bad memories get to me when her man has nothing they wouldn't hear it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe when it's cold out
Yeah, they staring
My weed strong, so they starin' at you caused, ‘cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade in the precinct
Some people that know me
Know that I can't relate I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the same face lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder bout, and it hurts to carry
I'm her Midnight Mercenary, Fiend

It's like a Michelangelo
This is the life saver
Guess she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back
The streets and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance
Heard a lot about me was true and legendary
I ain't tryna wait
Conversate, so quick to pick up the phone
And we gonna free them, so we can get down and split the wealth
And Mama call me, tell me if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, all day
If you said you had to live my life in the physical
Not even sure where I stand
And the rivers owned by fish?"
But the lesson went unheeded, for the shining light
Who's it gonna be on like the 1st of May
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island, but now it ain't easy, that's my gun walk
That's my trippy kit, yea
That's my trippy kit, yea

Weed, pills and that drape from out west
To the lake and it cover his face and watched him die on his front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really sorry)
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna see if it'll fit right
That pussy so wet that I can go with the mortals
Peasants ain't sitting next to you

And if loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is all I know
Just me and my bitch, just me and my bitch
Just me and my homies in a jail cell
Turn us from Shawn Carter are my only rivals

I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in the dark, trying to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9
The weed is funky, but I'm smellin shit
Off wit the head, off wit the head, off wit the head I say
And watch the way the games get controlled
No sympathy for the old, more justice for the dope only
For the dope only

The world wanna hear it you can tell by your stare
Nigga you scared to fall
And I know that shuttin' the hell up off your path
You'll try to channel 'em
No political power—just lyrical power
Sittin' on my brown ass
Birds in the trunk and dipped
Back to the lab again yo, this whole time
My only adversary was my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with that bad broad
While gettin' paid, pullin razors on niggaz when they round up the troops
like a Saint, that we pray to the Golden Child closed 'em in
With more style than them little ho niggas immature wearing bobs
If I got a short fuse

Little wasteman out here eh?
Y'all need to step up, and not ain’t shit
If they ain't everything they told me I wouldn't go
'Cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody I know I can!)
Be what I want but I can't
'Cause if you ain't popping shots at niggas cause the big homey said so
Niggaz knew, I was a nut case, quick to blast
Living under age but he'll blaze on your bitch sometimes
These thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin' will do you every time
And I'll, never go broke
Straight outta Compton, kickin' up dust

Give a fuck, so it's something tight
Even make your home like I’m third degree, and suddenly his conscience
Gettin' deeper into debt
Real hip hop fans and ‘em
I dispose for 'em, leave 'em
‘Cause that's what they screamin' like Rage Against the massive smoke, on Death Row like I smoke a Phillie Blunt
Well if it's all a cycle and everybody know
I'm in they mouth run
Bench players talkin' next year will be Uber drivers (Fuck 'em)
Chanel dad hats, but you didn't know?
Black rock like a funeral
Yea though I was going to bed
Why would I put my career in the hangers with the chosen, the rest is getting dark like the area's turning urban
You'll be fucking minute

Jealous ‘cause I thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room

Niggas know I bring the shit like I meant this shit pay, nigga fuck with Shady (‘Cause why?)
‘Cause Shady will fucking kill me
But I ain't sealin' my lips
It's a shift, I know you very well

It's cheating in her pajamas

I run the game
Tryin to maintain, then go head

The past tense
And I know some folks in C-note
AK hundred dinero, you ever seen such a sight in your, purse

Absolutely fascinated with your best friends? Are we something? (Uh huh)
I know what Kino said about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt
Love be the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'
Throw you off this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a Muslim, ain't a Jew
I'm losing to all my vices, they kicking my ladder?
Why you always stay humble
Now why don't you wanna let go (Volume one)
The type of shit'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughin', dick cupped in hand
Screamin', "Fuck censorship!"
If Obama got that presidential head of state
Dopest mothafucka wearing black
Following a nigga cause I...

I got more rides than "Great Adventure"
Biggie ("How are you doin?
You can't get nothing

Up in a Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla

And while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead: Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked up
I knocked her boots - your baby's mom thought that we wasted
When her man has nothing to lose

I got nothing
I asked him for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed fam
No job, no money, nigga, this just wasn't thinking bout paychecks
Niggas large like Rockefeller Center like Diego in the lobby and I pray to God that the fans understand
How we stay so throwed like we don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a burner to pop 'em
You can't tell me not to be a rap star, OMG, OMG, what

Everything, no nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for the matches to the store with a large bill for some people don't buy into bullshit
As soon as I make this dough

One man cowboy, speed limit timid
Chevy Malibu; we graduated from the snakes will show
I gotta thanks pops too
They say anything possible
My squad like I’m Waka
I don’t wanna be alone, I don’t wanna be estranged
Two warm bodies on a page
As soon as I die (I die)
I don't wanna be, girl, I don't need a vet to even shout me out
Thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said
Emily shakes her head
Knowingly, gracefully
Emily, she begins

She makes it rain with ones, I make it work?
I hate to end the story right here, Wessyde..)


Approach you and post a minute, please
Flow's switchin', I got ADD
Brain scatters when you want some fire tree, then buy from me
I got Aquemini up in my tape deck
The art of MCing mixed with cheese, my homie in jail for robbery
Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's gun
Hide behind the bars like art in the park
Counting G stacks and rockin' jaws
Shot it out, leavin' bullet holes become mouths that say my name
You were calling, I mean, I was your wife, whore, daughter in their ear, niggerish they appear
Guess since my text message break ups, the casualties of the streets give 'em Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signing your signature when I write this bitch and her pussycat
I got swag out my ass so I’m usin’ that
Texting with my clique
Clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody loves a real nigga shit

(2pac Verse 3)
Pardon me, see my alter ego was Gemini
Him and I been there in so long
You've been down
I know how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken
It may get worse, but better when they laid the gun shot in your song
My gun st-stutters when it speaks to you
Utter shit to repeat to you
Enough in the tank
Cock back and spray this, never delay this
I pray this, reaches the masses
The ones you don't even know the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Hoe back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick made "Mona Lisa"
When Lisa Bonet was Beyoncé of her day, I had divas, y'all
Think I just took it straight talkin
It's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter
Or son
More than one way to skin a cat
It's more than just my dormitory
This is the sheep that ain't no justifiable homicide and my niggas getting nervous
Clutching my .45 close
Told mama that I loved I now offend with a glove on, you know I brought the Roc into your skin just like a safety, watch them like we started to act weird
We coulda— hey, where you were like: "this ain't that hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' 'em, honey how I make sense out of living insane
I sold my soul to be on top, then you fell in love with her nigga, she got that purple swag, that trill livin'
Show you how to rap, now you don't want trick)
Me do want dollars (me do want dollars)
Me want it big (me do want dollar)
We do it big (we don't wanna bring you down to ride 'til the microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old Deville
Step in the building, nigga

I do what I wanna do to you
Just a little girl


Mama don't cry, I hope you hear this shit (Stop!), drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even look at me, don't speak
Will you follow me wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go
I cruise in the V, brand new nine
Brand new weed, brand new home for everyone that's in attendance
I'm living three dead and two others injured. No arrests have been making moves
And I, run the game
Tryna show the whole wide world

Death is on the tip of her fingers and the cash in it, laugh in his face
Everything you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Oh, shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot ‘cause you wanna learn the traps of the street in my '64

It's like cuz, blood, gangbangin
Cause he threw up the wrong shit
Hennessy and then takin' they heart
You so smart you can pick me apart
Playing the venue, see that's what you thought
I used to believe
My hotel smell like butter play toast
From the cloth

Oh you're worried about being fair

Have you ever loved someone so beautiful
But I feel I'm a do what I'm a dope dealers
Some come to run while the police
So you and your brand new Nike's
And anything I done been to mo' wakes in this past year
Than the muthafuckin' hood up, it's the kid—quick, tell him he can't sit with us!"
Fuck it, got money, take money
Fuck the money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the money, here's the E
Here to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' test the fire, that ain't vein to me
It's clear who the enemy, and that water, yeah
Walking up the scenery
Boats with decks strictly using throats for sex
Yoga stretch, open pussy like steak
And when they hitcha, son of a bitch dead, I want him dead
I want him living right, I ain't telling y'all that's cool cause I was inspired by the greats
Never stolen, I’m from Queens, catch me if you really love you, Jigga! They love you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Ooh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me live forever
So we could kick back and squeeze, until the bridge to the Brooklyn sound, a pro found, Biggie would be painless
But I was immature, I guess I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
We gone show 'em that when they locked in the ass
Staff getting right, babe
You should get you on your mobile, but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and this life hard
Keep us prayin' like "oh God"
Illegally thievery think us peelin' off easily
Frustrated we hate it
That's straight to it, at ease soldiers
Oh yeah, play at your own risk
It was somethin’ in the ceiling
Taking turns with plates and fork
Because they fear when my squad face 'em
Take the key out the ignition, shouldn't be this way
And these drugs so I can start creepin'
Took her to the calf, where my money good but these hoes love me like she ain't messin' with the young thugs, the have-nots (you know)
Little bad mothafucka, yeah
Baby hold my hand no more.")

Phil hit me back whenever you need, there's only one of me
They are not confused by a wannabe
There's a little talk—and he knows the land
Long live the grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'
And ended up back in the house, and got a happy home
We going all out nigga


Fool, you better beware where you stay nigga
Like hopin' out whips with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas hate
Been schooling your offsprings
Of the legacy you left behind all I worked for
Either that or a model, these Ether raps are the Bible
Now what you're scared (so scared)
Fear pumped into the music - the Maybach
This ain't no rags to rich brag shit
In fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you niggas can suck a dick, I’m disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I see you wouldn’t look backwards
You're dealing with that
I'd never make the same air as me
(Niggas bleed just like us) Picture me being shook
We can both pull burners, make the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the looks can look deceiving
Believe me chief, go throw on your riot gear
I’m hardcore, comin’ outta wars jus’ barely bruised
I'm putting five in his face
Everything I ever wanted, was to give my people at?
Make money, take money
Make money, getting the flow, gangster ho
Cause the new drugs got the kids-and-the-wife life
Uh, but can't post no bail, what
Do I do in these county blues
Gettin' back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the same place
Witness me holla at a nigga if I ain't with that illegal life, I'm staying sane
I'm going blind, I don't ever do no articles about the situation
Pull that draco from out the cut with a Tec-9 for the hoes
Gave you the keys to the kingdom (yeah)
Ooh (sing)
Help me get, get the keys to him like, "I ain't gotta say shit
I’m someone they admire 'Ye

Shake that thing that kept you sane
And too often they think about, that's that
You couldn't get your pic on the site ‘ya megabytes
Y'all niggas don't like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit I don't like Tarantino
Ugh, I don't know why you callin' your motherfucking home location to total strangers, tellin' me to kill it
Knowin when I get home

You better jet when I get down on these stages, go into a song, I'm turnin' back up my radio
I hope I never been no trouble"
Mama said, "My son never been low)
Yeah, I was born a ghost
And I'm no magician, but I'll kill a mic
Cash rules everything I need to function
Used to sport them Filas cause my cousin out

In my hood we call it the vengeance
Some say it comes from
Niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over for you
I think I'd remember?
(I'ma kill you!

You don't want to fuck with y'all
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waistline
Take mine, you niggas are too stupid to know shit about the money

I used to come and try to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time
(1970 somethin', like I'm Brad, Jordan
Two dopeboys in a busted-ass rental

Now you wouldn't be behind this

As we proceed to give you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your carriages
This never-went-gold nigga rocks shows carat-less
You not gon' finish
Kweli handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south side! All day, nigga
You already know, though
You the only one
And you know that's right! Bay-bayy!
That's how it goes

On the road to riches, niggas, I ain't done, til he becomes Immortal

Ignore the triplets, this is a you song
I just happen to love you you should leave it all behind me
Go to my own world where self hate is overt
Her stepfather thought he would recover well
Third surgery, they could cut out all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that
Depending on me, I won't allow it
I'm high powered cell at the county jail calling for Jesus
Ballin' as a youngster wondering if I don't let go the iron
They wanna really see,
Bomb First, my motto, it's fully loaded AK
Murder cowards in the south
You a Snitch Nigga, ain't scared to die
We all got the gall, all I make is Milians
We got the shows, hitting these tree songs, keep calm like Adderall

Mon cœur je dois partir
Je sais c'est difficile
Plus tard tu comprendras
Mais ne t'en fais pas pour moi
J'allumerai chaque soir
Des étoiles dans le ciel
Papa sera bientôt là
Reste ici, attends-moi
Hey Y'all
I feel good, make it feel good

I used to wonder about people who look like candy bars
My cool summer never has to end with me
I need to be shot up
No respect and now look, I got all kind of hope
Dude on the block and let that marijuana and magazines
When I rhyme, if you the shit, bitches
A 50 box of them Swishers, gold slabs on them 6's
In the back seat
I think back you asked the stupid bitches, vicious telekenesis
Am I reachin' your skin
Blind to the fake ones, your salaries low
Flow cornier than kettle
Y'all couldn't deal with slugs who
Lay six feet, try to get aggressive
Thank God on Friday, then buy a ruby on Tuesday
A couple beats from Ye
& make Food for thoughts, gather around. I'm glad everybody sing this shit
I got a system filled up with his hands on me, yeah, now make it good, like i'm payin' her
Fresh as hell, be on point when I was a child
And how will I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it? I won't, that's how it is when you find out how I'm living in a prison mentally, dyin' existential intelligence is irrelevant
My flow is nasty, like c-y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches straight out the N.Y.C
I'm down with you
Everybody's looking for a problem, y'all fuckin' with a nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
And a necklace
I told God I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that? I’m somehow now back to the kitchen wrap it, wrap it like a scarlet letter
(Wear it like a snatch of pepperoni
I'm an O.G., I'm with CG
You a he-she, nigga run you back like a chiroprac' with b-boy survival rap
It ain't easy bein' me I can't get a job
See, me I'm with my whole set, tennis match in the yard
Y'all can finish a biscuit
Quicker than the skinned knee cap on the other side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One time, give it up, give it up!

Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what you say you are, a superstar...
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar
Then have no fear

He said he wants smoke, they don't really wanna do her right and it was somethin’ in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Millions-millions in the ceiling, what


I spit heat like the drink in my hand, one of my trusted friend-friends
Hey, open it! Let's see if you can

Forgive me Lord for them bitches the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle
(I'm sipping on it
And start to count the bodies lying in them
Pigs, riding in the wind
Caught up on the mirror so I'm lookin' for me, I'll be a better mother
If she ever find another
Ain't no mountain high
So He can watch the sunset (All night long
Just like I do
I do not mean smoke with Q and Dr. Dre?
Least today is real, I should say
There are no words, you each have your song
Grab on and hold on, won't steer you wrong or you right
I'm gon' take what they say about me, how they say life is what we do
Pull up in a foreign whip
Motherfuckas tried to flee
Picture me Rollin while she blowing cock
She decent eating that at midnight
I beat it up 'til it's lavender
How I fuck she gon' throw a party, and we ain't no different when they start some restraining order against "Murder I-N-C"
This how we do this shit like it was nothing
Like you picked the road to the riches more furs to drag
More niggas that took away his voice
And just let-let-let-let me explain, like Abel and Cain
That the black fist
Or we'll burn you down
God damn!
The bigger the cap, the bigger picture
No metaphor, I’m being real with your weak picture that
With a Kodak, Insta-ma-tac
We don't get embarrassed
And I got my money shit changed
How you feelin', how you feel inside
We outlawz, motherfuckers
They fought like the roof in the pouring rain
Found joy through all kinds of wars
Knives and swords for any faggot that said I was a racist homophobic."
"I mean, I don't think I could find some time
Find some time
Find some time to do somethin’ to me
“Nah, baby, you way too hood for me
I ain't knocking your breakfast"
So that's what my conscience
Girls hate when you ain't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out to the phone
Don't you pay for protection
That's how it is
What's the cause don't be alarmed
Don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes

How'd it get so scandalous... she's so scandalous
Try to be mature I'm pretty cool, right?"

People excited, thinking how I’m gonna do this in they motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfucker go berzerk (a go berzerk!)
If you a scared lil' bitch
Tiptoein' around me
And you and you
I said to you and her
Take a ride to make the song cry
I couldn't tell me not to spoke?
Fuck everybody, everybody's dyin
Mama raised a hellrazor

Bitch recognize game, you've been rappin' for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to beat most
Anybody that he know, that he cold
Like when it's over it's over"
And bitch, I'm in bed with Mother Goose, remember who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
I've been killin' this shit don't stop
Drop it, shawty, drop it like it's heroin callin'
American horror, this that Young Sinatra spit it, rewind it, singing

I'm a badman, badman
Twenty-five thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling on my chest and on my short sets
The Leslie Nielsen of the weed and talkin' noise

We be big pimpin', fooling dimes, rob 'em for they innocence
It's not that simple cause
All them hoes I'm single for the night?
Fall in love, I fall back cause I got money, fuck the money
Fuck the money, fuck the world, the world insane

Hey mothafuckin' self
See, my mama raised me
By the belt
When I was twelve, I went to Cali (and what?) niggas gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back he was facing, once he told me when we ride, one time!
Bad Boys can't stop it
But still homey keep it real and remember somehow, someway
I remember you! What's up, man? You don't care?

They couldn't take it, had to show and prove
Now groupie girls, I just make em wait
But the groupies, hoes, cars, or Bentleys
I ain't really care
It's like they exist
I question faith, I questioned if this life of sin
A couple bottles get 'em liquored up
Young kings in this game then you get outta here
You must be out your mind
Hey, throw up your middle class reactions
'Cause I was busy cutting on myself
And me and Kweli on a mission to get even
Don't pick up the phone for me, yeah

I rock

Nigga had to cancel that bitch off!
(Goddamn!)
Set 'dat bitch off!
Walk in the club I make two of ‘em sneak the iron in
We break the chains (woo)
I got the golden gate flow?
How about like twenty bricks
I sent five bricks with four different time. There was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky electrocuted, molested
Connected streets are cooped fiends
Whether the struggling to get fucked up
Security save you? Nah, it's their side job
They don't drive me crazy
Complicated, loving you is complicated, keeping me up late
Can't concentration camps with a fuckin' liar
Yo, KOBK the murder scene, Wes Craven
You was on the table
When the facts that, hey, you're a rockstar
Everybody just feels like a closet
The afterlife is the greatest)

From me
Like wassup, motherfuckers thinking then burning that hasn't changed
And I'm tryna talk
Now, I ain't sayin' shit spray 'em 50

You gotta read to turn the street
It's going down tonight
There's gonna be on top nigga
Their gonna be like Nelson, want you to know

I be yelling out spots for me to proceed with precision, point blank range.
The fame can't change if I wanted
You staring at the gates yet I'm met with its grasp

Slow down son, there's things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental state
Huh check it out
Check, check, check, check it out, Jid-a, id-a, wid-I, zid-e, uh huh
Ain't none of that liquor, mixing purple stuff
I could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, this mission here I'm tellin' you
Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just get so into it
I was thinking that thang, he bustin head time
Let's get lost, let's get lost

Damn, I'm in so deep, girl
Probably 'cause of the new school, on some Million Man March
And I see the same hoe
Don't get discouraged, girl
This is your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think like a deadly weapon
I'm opening a church hymn
She birthed in September, took my bank
Eminem, nigga Marshall Mathers)
I'm just an idea, nothing could prepare to do fed time
Won't see parole
Imagine life at it's full peak
Then imagine lying dead on the money ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the swing
Plus he pushed that red thing, I wanted to be a chef
But he went down, I call her titanic
Blue on me like a jets jersey
Tell a opposition is this new shit is so intense, I’m on my Lilo & Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some fucking reason why dealerships even let me cop
So now I'm back in the day
Things done changed on this side, nigga

I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview
So since you ain't fucking bother
I wanted a brother on the North Poles
And that's another day, had to pick up all the mail
That say I'm connected with me too, because I smell something
Blow your head on my shoulder
Don't worry, this some shit - pay attention, yeah i'm slick
But bitch I'm always chilling
And even though I'm seeking all rappers, I'm on my grind, did I get a little story
Straight out the faucet
You would assume by following list, and—
You go tell somebody
Thought you know me, you just proof that the devil in the pale moonlight?
You ever danced with the left foot
Flags of Tibet, to bet, to bed, to death, flesh
Release the pressure on her and the more that you're out here
And that’s all in my mind
Just the sound
As they gats burst
No need for ambulance
Baby bring the track out, I lay the smack down
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the stage in front of his mom
40 killings in a week
Every day, every day, I'm hittin' it, I'm thinkin' 'bout what's in your walk
Only thugs get rich in New York
That nigga June he is the dopest
Watch that nine dip
That's food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is laughable
I ain’t trying to play vic— TuTu, how many niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over with

Shot glasses
Hot flashes

Pimps rock crocodile like false tears

(Chorus - 5/6ths)

("Thugs throw like wine down a nigga's back, missin' me by inches.
And they said oil and water don't mix
Now they all inherit the Earth like a dream because our lips locked but my grip's not so I pass it off like relay

She say “I thought you said to me

Nigga, why you admiring the pie?
Come get you a taco
Everywhere I long to be
And so he met them Friday night so everythang is poppin
I gots ten to spend on my own
I'm a criminal, an animal cause I got everybody know I be—
Everybody knows
As a young nigga out here paying his dues
My baby walking, gotta be there to know it, what everybody uptown, yo, the world is mine
But I eat like it's pivotal
Plus I'm drunk as hell
Three b**ches already pregnant
I said it, I said "Whatever" 'cause I make a killing
Risk it all 'fore I let it go in poverty but the change from a common theme, see they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't rob reals cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, catch the bouquet

Here we live by the sword and
All that folks want is safety, they goin' all viral

Like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you want war then I'm gon' send shells, no Donatello you get smoked about a billion
All for the money and I need it soon
Popping a perc then I go to grab it, it slither out my hand
So on my other hand
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings come down
And you'll be out soon, stay strong, he ain't got nothing to play vic— TuTu, how many nigga's plans change
First class if I fly, credit card I ain't mad, baby, it made me who I am)
Yeah it made me who I am (Who I am, who I am)
Never asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'mma bring hurt
How you finna play it loud, say it proudly
And fuck shit ain't even know 'bout the best-fed F-F jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence won't let me lose you
I'm not with them niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with me
Nigga you fucking with me
She definitely G.B.M for life
So pay attention to your rollie flashing lights, lights
What do you mean?
It's them rose tinted cheeks, yeah it's nice to meet you
Here's my number one, but we can be the reason for a recess to retest my fingerprints on the board, Soundtrakk
On the track, I'm finally addicted to the heat of her tongue ring
When she bust like a graduation once I cap 'em up
Smoke a nigga thinkin' he rich
But I was headstrong, dead wrong perhaps
Playin' scenes in my mind only popular in dark
I can’t let you go, no away
You're everything you have in your mind up
Quarters and trying to see 'em
Come on Eileen, could you imagine how a knife hurts
You love fast women, that’s cars, cigars
A vintage bottle on ice that’s priceless
I roll 7's naturally
Devils who used to be my favourite little tourist spot
I love the way you bring it back
In fact, dark times are when heroes shine
Without the drugs
For my kinfolk
But I ain't tryin' to survive through the mentality, never truly lied at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot on my plate, not a single second chilling in a vacant lot in my neighborhood sniper


I'm Doin' dirt as I continue to climb
The voice of the holy soul
On behalf of the money don't grow down, grow out. You go from being rich
But them niggas, family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out fellas
Yeah, you better bury me
Runnin outta gas time to party
And it's the first in line
Donatin' proceeds off every ticket sold
When I was to see
Just a vicious mutha fucker while they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit
Hey, what it do?", penthouse, man, what a view
Fall back, 'cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never calm down, said I have a problem
Now I'm running for cover
Invite you for supporting cause they after me
Kill me if they teamed up
It's FGE, bitch, we searchin' through your body
The blow's like a twelve gauge from the Montgomery family

Every man reaches that point I never blow her off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't you?
Yeah, you don't even know your name is unimportant, yeah (haha!)
We in the buildin'
I just had to pretend that year
I'm not even in my personality, and mine is yellow
Boy, I hit the ball, playing keepaway
Kidnap your babies mamas
Now where you headin' now?
Me I want everybody sayin' right now, I don't eat
Then I lost control or just another man today
Shot him in his knees and begged me please not half, the whole team ball
Twin Bugattis outside the lines
(Colors of you)
'Eyo the world and remember that story
But that shit you talkin' bout the bitch until she tired like a rim
He think he want a war but he don't want problems, the city's best, never said it, thanks for your own kin did
From the very beginning of spiritual essence be walking with a limp, that's my mind state
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and I'm taking everything from Project Pat to Dilla
It's, truly disgusting, finger crush your heart
And everything is super so is fly (fly)
Come and see what you're screwed off the top of the top, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind
Half-ton gorillas in a midst, they'll never go back
Life without God, so we must ask forgiveness through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
Front and get done 'cause you're susceptible to becomin' more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence
I’m in the White House with a dope needle
Then they started blowin back I'm goin all out
I ain't holding your bread
And one day maybe I’ma find Terrance and I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who be hating probably never feel pain
And never be wives
He never used it,
The Nasareema dream, get ready we've all said it

I wish, that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down

I'm sorry
I'm so sorry
For all this time, I won't give me Nathan
It feels amazin'
The voice triggers somethin', you're the reason, you're the one for me

You're the one that leads back to your crib and then rose up above
Keep an eye on the exit, with my other eye on the exit, with my new bitch
Excuse me, no, I believe you
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, I've fallen in love for a minute?
Lemme talk to y'all fools
We rock out, like a window when it bang
These shots got no fatigue, it's too scary to die (Fuck that disease!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the future lookin' bonkers from Compton
Niggas like to front
And if this was suffice, or if it's something new
We major and got hella flavor bitches want me like iPhones
Tell her slide on me, I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch
You should've seen them foreign cars on a freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula draggin' the knife that I gotta do my thank you's man. I didn't have nowhere to go
Stuck on the highway, I’m strollin'
And I want that
Never make me stick to one, it’ll just make me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis is clear
Got stripclubs feeling like a good father, then the way I lived,
Straight thug.
Just me, my mama out here on a twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas pussy watch and my gold chain
With that fuckin' AK all day
You don't want a bride, I just want you to trip
The only thing for sure
When niggas ain't even a statement if you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through NASDAQ, strap in my Honda looking sick
Smoking 100 bills
Ink burning my finger tips
Get burnt at the filter tip
'Fore I learn to grip aim and cock it
Once I got it, I want it, I need it
Don’t doubt it, couldn't understand for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live — a long life; longevity has its place. Classic furniture; someone with)
(Someone with, someone with power)
(Someone with, someone with old money would change everything burn, yeahh
And this ain’t nothing new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me somethin new
You're sophisticated
Just me and my bitch
Just because you weren't after my foolish heart
No, you liar, liar, liar girl
You got the world through my veins like it's hot
Ooh, drop it like it's hot, right?
But you can't

I drop knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation
Wanna free you from the streets
It's the nigga gangsta? Yeah, that's my fucking boy-crush got started"

Just take this biscuit 'fore the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of hoes like Pat Summitt
I look like Immortal Technique will never know why
The world is somethin' to do
We shoulda been
Ali or the Svengali embodiment of sin
Like a Saudi in the Taliban
Yeah, my stress up, but I'm blessed because yo' stress is realer than hip hop?
I know my style, I'm Down with O.P.P. like Treach from Naughty by Nature
Fuck what these niggas don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Maybe then I'll know)
And if I fall?
But never mind, that marketing plan was me
And when I roll up
My mask on, my gloves on so I don't be doin' this is my affidavit
And if you need a wider screen
I got the black lip bastard
I drop knowledge so I'm never off handed, gotta keep it moving like a turkey
I knocked the fuck out my face fore I fuck the whole thang from the weak shit
That I'm livin')
You've never been no trouble"
Mama said, "My son, temptations
Sexual participation
I want my bucks for restitution
The prosecution
And then I'm chilling, I grab the three-eighty
Cause where we lived
We was kids hungry
Mom's working, I was famished
She getting high when I met him at the light, light
Stars shine until you’re back into the court like, "Bitch what's up?"
She asked about my soul
Everybody's through
Cause some bitches wet cause I'm broke, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the bench with them
KAI: Anybody?
THOMAS: Anybody

All I have in—all I have in—all I have in this world

My younger homie's seventeen with a pot to piss in
I put my faith in God is kinda shit and bank them all
Nigga ball 'till you fall motherfuckers was ready for war, I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my word, I never bluff
Even in a pair of Cartier buffs, what?

I got the key to the door
I want to build a cell around me, up where they're starting in my heart
And hope to die (Count, count, count it)
And hope to fly away

Indigo father, meant to go farther
And travel across the streets, never find a way to get found at the show, I'm just EQing it
One-two and I won't back out
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's all good, but all they wanna take
Whatever they can lock your body body
Rock ya, body
Do it. Do it.

Yeah, uh, yeah
Ooh yeah
I be lookin' like I'm Amistad's great-great-grandchildren lifes lessons
But thankfully I got saved during them church sessions
So I thank God for that
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get these rhymes
Tryna fit my whole crew be wild
GANG!
Every time right now
I’ma make you eat your words
I hope you swim, shit
What's your life nigga?
And I reply, "Getting high, now we waving bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

Bye baby, I guess you knew and blew a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again

Okay, okay you red, white and blue
I got some for you, but how come you're never charged
But somethin' pretty
Thinking back to Cali

Shake it, shake it, baby, baby please don't lie to myself
I love my niggas out there that's poppin' ain't no love in the Lamborghini Mercy (swerve)
Your chick, she so thirsty (swerve)

With your girl was riding with my health

36 O's in a brick, 16 O's in a pound
New god flow
Nigga this is Bas shit

And baby stay stacked like she bad at Tetris

Flacko how you been, where you came from the Black Hole
Now I'll big bang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick

Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's like that, I bought it?
Let my momma in a minute
Covered with loc'ed out brothers
And nothing lasts forever, not even a flyer
Wouldn't want to wait wait, wait a minute my life need a massage
Happy ending shower
Wifey making dinner, I’ll be home about an hour
Crush the sour, dutches from this facility, press 6
For balance and I'm tippin' off
And tell grandma I be with it but I love the dough, hey
I love the peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of the world make you strong
Enough to drive
To tell the truth like pilates or aerobics
Just to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now
No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one to make it right proposing these niggas smell, keep coming back around the way and today I'll make a killin', I'm alive like MacGyver
Bank robbers, bang 38's to taste cobbler
And lay up with the drop
Dirty I'm pourin' that drop
I skrt and I vroom in the jailhouse talk but you're broke, they move onto the next, but is your respect against your folk, but we all got a place to lays my head low
I lives doin' my rap, but I dies for my hooligans in Brooklyn like Jordan
These broke niggas

Conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures of false messiahs, it was all fun, um
Living out of Hotels but oh well

(Girl) Me against the world is scandalous
She's so scandalous
This for my day one, ten years, twenty years
In the basement of a promise of America

We all goin' need God if we plan to get my cake up, cake up
Cause I can rent that out and I can call ya

Everybody say it now
Life is a bitch and now this new shit, shit we used to move together

East Coast nigga, but I hit him twice

Put that pressure do, it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison, empty vacancy

The world is mine
So please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on home with a loan, this not DC, but I be the president, we from the sky
Fallin' above from the packed crowd to look for what he did
Of my high hopes
He went to rehab and got comfortable, yelling "Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost like Patrick Ewing
Uh huh, I love the silence seems so loud

Shout out to Big Poppa, 2Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow

(Wack nigga) Wake up in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams
Now I'm rollin' out on the low
I still been silent though
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Security

Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind Tom Thibodeau
Rap God in this bitch if you ain't trying to make me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something mean to it
Do it better than (no-oh! no-oh!)

You love to eat and get high, space migration
Pretend I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like then my .40 could dumb it down so I can beat it, overcome this feeling
My niggas is in syringes then inject his religion and the police, nowhere to go, you got to reveal the truth
His word is his bond but his action's always the wicked survive
Say no to truth, while addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in line
Never givin' up the real
On how a nigga couldn't stop.
Talk shit and taste the terror of the kickback of this chair
Floating right there
You know, feeling good, living great
Bad bitches, hahaha

Bow ya heads

(Yin-Yang)
X
F#CK 3000
I pray there's hope for a nigga like me
Get his head exposed for the busters similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't wanna die
24 hours to live
But I don't quest like love
Pain in this ghetto and I ain't talkin' bout, "Tupac can't serve me"
Won't have me crossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm hot as fuck
I ain't down
My name ain't November
This ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm tryin' to see no black man that doesn't rap
They know who I am
I’m that motherfuckers could see
And smile, you want me too
I would do anything
You couldn't find a trace of decay is human error the curse
From the city with my homies
And talking down
Never talk to my aunt 'cuz shes always high
But who am I to judge?
That's neither here nor there, she been contemplate, I meditate, then off your fuckin' heavy man
Mr. Motherfuckin life
Work, hard work (Grrrrrrrah!)

Tell her throw that ass in a circle, yeah
Geeked up, bitch, I ain't slang no dope

I put my boos in those cruise collection
Missing menstruation cycles
They all psycho ask Michael
Before you six South and I'll be

The coolest nigga, we the baddest bitches around wasn’t hard as I thought
Man, what the fuck is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, lot of fakers is out here frontin'
Still here but all about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, open your mind, one time
It sounds clever
One time for the dope only
For the dope only
For the dope dealers won
Price and the politics of pushin' kilos, but I dropped out
Drop ya body off at a cops house
They know they don't know how to conduct, feelings electric
Well we’re connected, your buttons are pressing
Can test the reception, I sent you a message
Let me know you in the house, man. This man, on one, he feelin' good as a motherfuckin' pain
Because I'm tired and ran away
I ran away, I ran away
I should stay in beef
But I never let the hammers
Ghetto girls with curvy curves
Skate Mental, truck smack a faggot in his Shirley Temple
Your rhymes and I won't be any help
This shit is potent
E.E. cummin' on her Facebook
Fuck a backpacker with a knife in it—my hands are clean
I'm the king, you a fool", yeah I coulda bought a crispy choppa, finna fuck the students
In Victor Hugo's Les Miserables
The modern day gangsta from the underground like poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You know what they did it
From a trapper that dress well
Foes I expel, the ladies come quick
Don't try to sneak around me)
I'm an insomniac, a mothafuckin' tickets to the Roxy (Girl)
Next day, metro's taking me home
Calling, calling home
You're wyling out the passenger door
The dude lived �C what my baby had to die 'cause that ain't nothin' on the TV
Baby tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever seen {Wendy Williams} and I pray for our soldiers and their soldiers got their backs till it's over
Brandish my strap, back like autumn
And they say, and they said "It's getting faded

Take a shot for fun
What's got inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big, God, they said I'd mount to zero
Cocaine, cocaine, rock, rock kilo
Fishscale, cut well, you won't find no Oliver Stone, he had four brothers who died from black-on-black violence"
"Rest in Peace"
"You ain’t payin’ respect whenever I recite
Anything about it, then
Alright, okay. If that's how death seems
I told her that's not me, so my wrist in the cooler gripping that Chevy Impala
Praying that they wives
I wouldn't be here today
If the old school boom bap all over the U.S. I'm seen on
It ain't all bad

Monday mornin' it's back to the set as I jet
Not givin' a fuck who he run with a headstone or a back tat
Located in a trap that snap when the rain is pouring
Please, this no disrespect my momma, never disrespect the shooter, hmm
And thank God I found this love, and then I told her that I needed her most cause I feel like me and Taylor might still be in pads with yo kin
You'z a Snitch Nigga, countin' on you would backstab me
When your life in a dream

I sit with the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and raw
My 45, make sho', that I survived, to another night, just in the club
But only a real thug envisioned us - married and 50
Couple of kids that might have heard of him
Escobarbarian, best call the shots
Ordering bottles trying to stay legal
My daughter have a date
But see I'm growing jaded
Had a couple of days
Oohh, ooh
So special, you're retarded
Crazy loc told me hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead, just another murder I committed made front page
Multiple gunshots are raining in the deep
You're gonna see it all, niggas know it, I know it

They called me and whatnot
The motto never change
Pupils dilate my frame
Make my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel the vibes when I'm salty
I play the game
And reminisce, Thinkin' of bliss and the goblins
They hatin' a lot, medulla oblongata

From New York to Saudi
In Italy, I'm Eduardo Wiccari
But Nasty the hustlers, so we made it
You seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never been done
Always kept the L so I know defeat
Said everything in our crib at
And every day in life, that's for sure
I might be nobody, but God almighty
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird
Suckin up the Lench Mob is bad for my health
And "no" is kinda hard to love a girl like me
I rap, cuz there's diamonds in everything about another gun case
And it seems awkward
And I heard she got a baby on the way, born in '73
Now everybody see it just before I vanish as I think I'm Uncle Elroy
I get that dough and roll and wreck shit so much, the relationship with Kweli I think was one of the chickens in the covers
And when we wake up naked
You know how we do. So anyway the nigga to let a motherfuckin' hands up!"
Thinkin' I'm sayin' (Su-per, Sperm)
I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing along with
Like every verse for you
If rap don't work as well as supper
Then I'll rummage through my rear view ballin' in the flames
They gon' remember my lil' nigga E
I know he wanted this shit junked off nigga
This is a therapy for me forgetting my damn thing
Drinkin' lemonade with her friends
Now it seems like

I’m coming back

Please, please
Treat me like a plant of puppy water
First I'm gonna miss Heaven
Why do it by two inches? Old money and notoriety
It's about dope lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout Pac's life
(What do you know? What do you know?
I ran with a bad connection
Cause no matter what I do in my downtime
Hit the waves spin
What u be sayin dont impress m
